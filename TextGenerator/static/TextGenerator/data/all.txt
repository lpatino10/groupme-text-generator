😂😂😂😂😂😂
Talking about urinary incontinence in class and the professor starts talking about kegel's and everyone giggles then she goes "I'm doing them right now and you can't even tell!" 😂😂 
MESSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Anyone just see James' goal??
Poonslayer... when the going gets tough, quit. Has never failed me once you can't fail at something if you don't try
Write a strong worded letter how they are dumb and react is dumb
I can teach you that ez
Send nudes
Hahaha I'm feelin it
🔥🔥🔥
I always hated them no joke
I can call if you want
Your parents were yelling at eachother or your brothers were yelling at them after they broke the news?
You can't be serious
What????
😂😂😂😂 I freakin started watching with food and my mouth and almost had to spit it out!
Haha Anything to help! Not sure why people don't like it when it takes a second to do
Whenever! I'm watching 13 reasons why
Haha Nick we need your commentary!
@Nick Casto @Logan Patiño What are your guy's thoughts on playing RL with me and Zach?? We could even record it and we all get in chat or some talk app like discord
This is McCoy if we were to soccer golf in another neighborhood
Is it dope
The description of the 3 million view video: "A knight and a man who sells potions."
That's it 😂
I'm crying watching it!!
Guy in RL rn has the name Potion Seller and I died because that video nick showed us lol
I would have to watch a tutorial... google drive is for sharing things with other people
RT
How bad was the spill?
You poor man my life is on my Mac 😢
Who're
Let me know!
Logan and Zach too!
I'm playing now!!
PLAY WITH ME IN A PRIVATE MATCH!
That's like $8.75/hr but since you don't have to pay for food or housing with that 3.5k that's pretty good!
It's practically a job interview and 10 week networking event
I would do it for free lol
Congrats though that's insane how long is it?
Why wasn't I consulted before you accepted!?
YAASSSSS
Where at
Talk to me when you win a real title
Sick
The white guy
Wow
This game rn
I'll give it a look!
Not that I know of I looked on every channel
 But actually it's not on any of my channels so watching the Cavs making sure Kyrie keeps J Wall under control
Wait.. curling on NBCS.. someone keep me updated on the game
I was gonna ask if you wanted to play RL earlier but no one else was on
Nice!!
Game on actual TV?
I give you my blessing Nick
Don't think so
@Niel Skalican 
I would pound her
I could literally rest a plate on that booty and eat my breakfast off it
If every girl looked like that... 
WHO IS THAT
You got it mane! Turn off the basketball
What is it?
😂😂 I crack myself up sometimes
That looks amazing I would love to slap some butter on it and... well you know the rest...
Probably should learn how to bake a bit better don't ya think?
Umm.. anyone else noticing that dude is literally a human stirrup in the third picture.. you ask me he's the god
I am an educated white male and I understand nothing
Cinci always does well for their rank in March Madness
I hate you both right now
We're all hunting Bearcats on this blessed day
But I'm still going to root for UCLA
I have Cinci winning!!
Yeah it's sweet to see the highest level of college basketball but that bracket is what makes the difference between me watching all day or me just staying up to date
And this year is especially cool since everyone chose a different winner lol 
That's pretty much exactly it lol And if OSU is good then I watch them on TV when I can but not crazy enough college basketball fan to watch them if they aren't playing well.. I like NBA because it's way better basketball obviously since they're pros
Niel is next on the blocks let's see if he survives
THE DREAM SURVIVES
If Kentucky loses I want kicked from this group chat until the tournaments over so I don't have to face my shame
LoPa first to move into the Sweet 16
Hoe
Of everyone's teams I only have Logan and Julie's moving past this round 
Alright now it's judgement day for all of you!!
Michigan v Louisville
Kansas v Michigan St
Duke v SC
UCLA vs Cinci
Crew won
Galaxy won
Atlanta wrecked the Fire

nice.
Yep! I'm hoping for that
Dang.. honestly his last few albums weren't my favorite off the block but they always had to grow on me so let's hope
That's literally what David said
Nope :/ It wasn't on YouTube or Amazon music
Well everyone.. this is where I leave you.. 
Guess who never gets ice in his drink
What is it?
Nerd*
Need
^Literally why I picked them because I thought of you Nielson
Hahaha I picked WVU because I had to support Niel and West Virginia Tech
Cute
@Zach Spangler I'm really mad I have an exam Monday Tuesday and Wednesday or else it would've been sick to get on your server the second it opened!
Yeep
She was born here if that makes any difference.. they picked an American first name but a Vietnamese middle name kind of like you guys
Hahaha Welp
No middle name!? Emily has one 
It's a cool name how did she choose it?
Yeah but not her middle name then? 
Is Kire her middle name???
Kyrie
Making sure St. Patty's day didn't kill anyone
Is everyone alive?
Giving gifts on his own birthday? What a guy
I love jello
YES
Wow I'm jealous Julie only has Michigan winning 1 game
Top class 😂😂 Craig's finally got the jokes!
I'm dead
I realize I just said cheap and affordable 
Cheap, affordable, and you could stay with David!
tUT
Any other schools you're looking to transfer to
I would replace "stunk"
That sucks Craig I think it's fair to change for all incoming people but not those already promised
You scared Logan
That's your ticket to success Zach! Forget Ark the new thing is make up!
Hey I've thought of teaching too!! Like a hospital attached to a college which I could do both
Wowow I would never want to waste my time... that just doesn't sound like anything I want to go into especially for a job that will never challenge you after the first 3 years! Like 3 years in you would have seen it all and would have almost forgot all your clinical knowledge by 5 years in
YASSSSSS
I hate it! We shouldn't be let go because we want to further our education and work in a setting that will challenge us day to day.. plus there are definitely not enough hospital internships to go around for all pharmacy students who want residencies so we have no choice because to not have any pharmacy job basically means you're screwed
Dude Curtis said meijer is changing things around because they hate people having jobs then going residency.. I mean you would make bank but you would have no time to work.. 
As in March 2018
I apply in December and know by March
Haha Nah I have no clue yet! Nick imagine if you and I ended up in the same place and I did a PGY2
Win win win
Niel go to Arizona and then I will do my residency and live with you for my residency and then Nick will live with us when he does his residency
@Logan Patiño Who did Julie pick to win in her real bracket?? So far every one has someone different so that will decide it probably
He's practically asking to lose
😂😂😂
Jk 🤗
Woah woah why does Julie get two!?
I'm still at 0 points... since when do 12 seeds not win the first games
RIP Kennedy
So true
Yeah last year I barely even watched the tournament games lol
@Craig Casto 
Team name theme this year is rapper puns
Are you sure?
I was at bdubs today and watched the first 15 minutes of college basketball all year so I'm feeling good about St John's and whoever they were playing 
I'll play
I'm shocked..
Wtf!?
Zach
Heal your heart??
Umm
Nope leaving soon though
Nick you free tonight?
What you doing tonight ? 
Funny
State
I got excited McCoy then I realized you're in another store
😔
Well I'm coming home!
Who will be in Lancaster and free Saturday night??
SpangIndustries 
Totally forgot how much I like Bastille
I'll skype in so save some space for me
Having to make a decision is a good problem!? I could go my whole life without making a decision
Alright this isn't supposed to be an insult because we're proud of you Nielson.. but is Lexi going to have the final say or will you make this decision for yourself 
And that's sick!
Pittsburg is amazing David almost went there for pharmacy but didn't want to pay the price
Who crosses out the price Niel come on!
Seems like Arizona is giving you a lot of opportunity to reduce the out of state cost
That's hot
Aight so not worth me spending much time on lol
Anyone still play that Pokémon Duel game?
😂😂 
Classic
#SquadGoals
Probably because it's something you would do
^^just one leg I guess
We should've made the arms leg and body.. OP Exodia
And I'm dying explaining the GAF head to Emily hahaha

Bolt speedman

Logan remember those star wars unleashed games?? That's actually what he just downloaded I miss watching those for some reason
Anything that gets me off school I'm down
And 60 down??
My friend is trying to download a game in class for his laptop and he peaked at 1.1Mb/s
Jealous!!
Snowstorm!? It's sunny here
@poonslayer What did you say your wifi at MIT is? How many MB/s?

Blart
Wait.. Blart isn't Nick?? Wtf?
What's your favorite food Blart?
RIP
Got eem
Did you ask Lexi? 
I hate bicep tattoos probably my least favorite.. I advise getting a Mike Tyson before bicep
If that's actually a bet I guarantee I could raise the money
Well I'm not a tattoo guy so I already have my set view on them haha 
Are you getting it so people can see it visibly or where no one ever would?
Follow up.. so are you getting it to show others visibly or remind yourself where no one can see it
This is the greatest message of all time.. sorry Craig 
I would smash
I was just showing off my math skills nbd.. that sucks though I hate when they rush through slides
108 slides
Just coding nbd what you guys doing
Send me a post card when you're famous
Pretty sure that comment is gonna get 6 likes lol
Hey guys remember that one time McCoy posted a picture of Niel and his ex and he never responded to us because he's afraid to hear about his bad decision
Python
I would wear that hat
I too would prefer Prem I stay with it longer
Are there any head to head leagues for Prem? It's almost like doing both leagues in one
We've done the basics/genetics, hormones, infectious disease, cancer, and now neuro 
Hmm I wonder if we ever did GI
Should be "Remeron"
This class is so boring
He even keeps saying it
@Nick Casto Supposedly my medchem teacher things Zoloft is Zolofit 
Playing now actually
Truuu
Soccer is gay
😔
Shoot
That's what I thought you meant
I wanna be that pillow is what I want
Same
¡FELIZ CUMPLIRAÑOS, Mejor! Tiene un gran día. Te amamos ♥♥♥
Lvl2 pikachu waddup
So would you say it's worth downloading now or waiting till I can play more?
Just give me a Jolteon and I will beat it in a day
It looks a lot like clash royale 
So is that game something that you get stuff over time?? I have an exam tomorrow so I can download it after or today and let things build up
POKÉMON HEROCLIX!?!? HOW WAS I NOT AWARE OF THIS
Mine is ordered to come to Toledo 
Looks like you've been practicing your ball control
Craig it's your drug!
Remember when we made butter beer? Lol good times
Guys.. 
Oh god.. spring break
City's killin it
I now have 4 different professional groupme chats for school that people can see my beautiful avi pic
He's not wrong
SEND ME A POSTCARD BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW YOURE GONNA GET IT!!!
Hairy weiner
Come to Toledo first
Yeah I member
Yeah sorry Logan I can explain that if needed tho
Umm that would be too risky of a bet I would have to literally commit like the Friday before
I can only do things before June if that limits my availability for games
YES ONLY TAYLOR NO ONE ELSE
Craig wins
But let's remember that "ONE" time I was the guy who came between a relationship and I had all my sneaky ways and was always trying to get my foot in the door somehow and that's what he is doing.. now will it work.. no.. but is it annoying and can I predict every move from experience (unfortunately)... yes
Yeah Nick I feel bad for ya I feel everyone's opinions might be different because their experiences
Like my big thing is I'm not like getting emotional on you guys lol I'm more trying to be practical but I think I am 100% right and almost wondered if I'm not 
McCoy your input is the other thought in my head haha It's like I truly don't think anything will happen almost 100% sure other than him trying ridiculously hard and her probably just flattered by his embarrassing attempts but it's more me annoyed with her not telling me or caring what I said.. I have somewhat taken your mindset this far since this came up like 2 or 3 days ago and hasn't resurfaced because I'm just trying to not care but it puts those subconscious thoughts in my head like do I really have to say everything and anything I do anymore? Kind of annoying
Yeah asking price difference should be first before like getting too assertive
You feel me Zach... and Logan I agree with that too but like do I have grounds to be 100% right in saying no you can't stay with him
I suspect 0 cheating if I were her I would not do anything with him but it's uncomfortable and he will try to be flirty
Well okay now it's time to throw the last bit into the conversation I didn't want to throw her under the bus but she never actually told me... she was talking to someone else in our class who was going and said it and when they walked away I was like "umm"
I mean she's an only child and her parents are basically made of money
Yeah Niel you could be right!
Would you expect her to instantly understand and not do that?

Well I don't think she is at all interested in him and like I said I'm not threatened he is kinda weird but it's uncomfortable and she didn't care when I said I wasn't comfortable with it
Like take a more expensive room, let's say 500 instead of 400... split that in 4 and Emily is paying $25 extra dollars
Heck no lol 
Okay thank you sir so second part... I already told her I don't approve of it and I'm not comfortable... her excuse is it can save her some money (probably not much at all) and that I'm not going because I don't feel like spending $500
Alright I know bro opinions!
So there is a kid in the class below me (who I am not threatened by) who has tried to hit on Emily and even tried to convince her to leave me yet failed but now she is going to some meeting in San Francisco for an organization and he is too with two of his friends (1 guy 1 girl) and they are all going to stay in a hotel room together obviously she is sleeping with the girl but what are your thoughts on that?
AIDS? Bactrim
You will learn about so many and be taught all the horrors of resistance and super bugs coming from our negligence but doctors will continue to give pip/tazo or any other broad spectrum just to cover their butts... the system sucks
There are a billion of them man lol good luck 
#SummerInternshipSwagg
Spring Break: 4th-19th
Look who's the most cultured here
I would pay your parents my wifi and food bill for the past 10 years
But don't you think she would like pay everything off for Emily or something
I will high ball her and spread the wealth
"You're my last hope"
I met her once she came to our graduation! I introduced myself
Maybe if I write her a letter she will consider
But I'm her best friends boyfriend..... technically speaking if Emily and I get married then she will probably first or second woman in the wedding
50k to someone with 1 million dollars is 5%
50k to someone with 1.5 billion dollars is 0.0033%
For real...
Emily's friend is rich and just got 1.5 billion from somewhere and I'm like she literally could pay for all my stuff and a simple thanks would be enough
If one of you got 1.5 billion dollars today would you pay off the rest of our college debt for everyone in here?
Also what else would you do with it?
So I'm heading into Lancaster that way for an oil change but I wouldn't be leaving here for like 50 minutes ish is that fine?
Roads are sort of bad so drive slow
LEBRON PLAYIN
Waddup
If everyone can decide somewhat quickly 
Yeah but Craig can't tomorrow lol So it's whatever everyone else is feeling
So hang out tonight or tomorrow night? I gotta know so I can text my pharmacist back 
Shoot let's hope the "questionable" is just a saying.. I want to see Kyrie 
No way they have to play! 
Nah you're fine 
What time?
I'm in Cleveland for the Cavs game so I can't tonight
Nice! Pharm just asked me to work Friday 9-5:30 but I might say make it 10 and he's got a deal lol
Ye
Thursday night???
I'm in let's pick a night before it's too late! 
Oh dang never mind I will trade you
I only say tomorrow because the $5 movie night or else we would reschedule if you want and still could I guess if needed!
😢
Like if you're feeling River Valley Rogue One tomorrow at 7:10p!!
It was pretty insane
I take back my Bickle comment then but you should still come Craig!
😔
I thought he was going to family's house?? Craig you're invited!! You don't have to sneak away and give Shae Bickle the goods this year!
Aight I will eat then come
Who's at Logans already?
What time we getting pizza?
I only do PC gaming sorry guys that's I'm not so old fashion 
So everyone in this chat plus Julie will be there tonight??
Haven't played since last tourney
FOR REAL WTH
And are we hanging tomorrow night for New Years?
So is soccer golf tomorrow morning??
Oh it's tomorrow!?
Nice!! Gotta make it count we're never all together!
So that's 7/7 right!?
My jersey isn't here yet either but I'm cool to hang and for the SOCCER Classic!
😳😳
What did everyone get??
Craig you tried man.. that lady just sucks
7
Nick when do you take oncology? Still any thought on oncology specialty?
I had cancer on Monday :) I survived and had a complete response
Looks like tonight sucks!
Last final at 8am.. gonna need all the help I can get on this one!
Take it as you will everyone but my vote next year is to just do one fantasy.. A one time takes all focus the whole time then a down season
The struggle
I really gotta start playing

2 finals down, 3 to go
Finals week begins 😩
Say goodbye to our captain
Dang wish I was there
75.. just clenched the gold card
Neymar a 92 in FIFA 17 😳
Wait... that was about me I messed up my "your"... I'm embarrassed good bye forever guys
Craig come back when you're older than you're brother.. then we'll talk
Just keep trying Craig! 🤗
Nice avi loser
I've watched a few start up ark vids so I have some clue of what's going on
Nope! All in the boxes building once I get home
Ahh gotcha that's so true... well even if you pre recorded you can bring it so I can learn over break! Up to you!
Can you transport your PC home?
People just don't like the coaster vids they are all there for ark
I'm afraid you're switching to rust! I only will get one lol And Ark seems like my choice for now
Zach I'm currently watching your video
Nah they all look fine interaction wise.. I had to look up the Zonegran and Banzel but judging by it that person must have a huge seizure risk.. 
YES FAVORITE THAT TIMES 10 I just lost it in the middle of some students presentation lol
Look at Craig's professional photo.. you got Logan's as dog, me as a tomato, and Nick taking Logan's dignity away
Agreed, Craig don't make this a hostile environment
4 more for me as well
Two finals down!
Yeah I'm out :/
Make sure Craig is invited
@Niel Skalican 
@Craig Casto 
Like this message if you can commit to New Year's Eve morning! 4/7 members liking means we do it
New Year's Eve morning or New Years morning?
My pharmacist wants my availability by 4
Let's get a date so I can cal off work
If we can get a vote ASAP so I can tell my pharm
Dang.. so many just leave it the 24th? Or try the 23rd when you're here??
I need to text my pharmacist for when my working days can be
Also when is Christmas classic happening?
I got picked for the APPE block I want but it goes from June-September
I don't think I will be able to go on a vacation this year
I have bad news everyone
Dang boi! I don't have one yet!
It's about that time to start crunching all the numbers for what I need on these finals!
Wow that's too bad.. really hoping everyone else is fine
17th maybe?
I'm not fake
Bro I'm just being me
Speaking for myself, I know I do
The Facebook thing is basically a talk about guns of course
I'm watching a live stream Facebook thing
What!!! 
Any update?
I'm on google now looking that's insane is it still going on I can't find super recent updates
That's pretty neat!
Confused
😔😔😔
😂😂 No worries I will be there soon
Did you tell them their turn is up in 4 minutes?
How long they there? 
@Logan Patiño Is anyone still at your house?
I'm leaving soon!
👍🏽👍🏽
So 7pm works?
That's cool tho you can have the music room 
Bro night these days comes but once a semester!
I can stay up as long as everyone else does
Uber everywhere
I'm thinking ping pong, pool, FIFA, and hot tub
You bet!
CRAIG
I'm going tomorrow!
AYYY
¡¡¡¡¡¡
Name?
Julie might be there
McCoy are you sure that's not a fake address?
What's the address?
Logan the only time I've seen you happier than a hole in one on an arcade game is the time you saw a bird... I worry sometimes
@Craig Casto You coming Friday?
Doritos are Doritos I'll eat them all! Could be cool tho! 
If he supplies some sweet chili Doritos he's got my vote 
Wait I haven't heard anything from Craig the Crippler is he coming?
He could always replace McCoy that's about all he's good at 😘
Is he good at ping pong, FIFA, and hot tubbing?
NJ?
You're good how'd it go?
So is it a Friday night sleep over for sure?
That's one idea
You won so you pick how we do the tournement for the belt! Like last year it was the three transfers to a 4 star team
@poonslayer You're responsible for the planning of the FIFA tourney this year! Make me proud!
Haha Okay well tell him to come over Friday! 
He comin to bro night?
Can we do Friday night?
So when we hanging out over thanksgiving?? Everyone propose a date so I know how to plan my time home
I hear Federer won the Open with one of those
Aight
Julie J
Ur girl 
Sent ✅
I forgot lol
Told you all he's the next big thing
Totally agree it's easiest for me to look at it from a standpoint of not supporting either of them.. I read last night more about why we even need the EC and I guess it does make sense to regulate votes based on region but I also agree it greatly depreciates the value of one's individual vote yet doesn't render it "useless" so I see everything better from both sides and started understanding things more this election
Pic from Facebook 
My grandparents are like 100% trump and all they talk about is he will stop abortion so I can see the >45 stats if they can generalize that population
Those NY times numbers are very interesting! It's funny how everything almost looks in favor of Hilary but whites outnumber everyone so much that all he needed was that one stat
For sure! Next election I might be done with school stuff to invest some time lol
Hahaha Agreed that's so true!!! 
Wow it's 12:30... I've had this on for like 5 hours
I'm afraid we are changing for the worse what if this becomes a trend and either of them endorse some other under qualified person
You are not wrong sir
Especially with someone as crazy as him that is dangerous! 
He wins Pennsylvania in the next few min he for sure your new pres
Crazy how close this is I went into today almost 90% sure Hilary had it in the bag
Good point....... 
Evan McMullin 4 Utah!!
But if I voted third party what difference would it have made? Gary Johnson go from 2.9% to 2.90000000001%? Not trying to be sassy but for this election I hate both candidates and relying on the difficulty to pass things through congress to buffer them out
I'm watching the election coverage! That counts!
McCoy we will all chip in $5 to help you get home if you at least consider
I will be home Wednesday night but work early Thursday so my availability is Thursday night
Jerseys you have
Teams/players you like/dislike
Size
Sleeve length
Who previously got you
Who you previously got

All to JULIE by Friday!

Let's have a cut off of when everything needs to be in
GET EVERYTHING INTO JULIE
Well my uncle asked about a ping pong paddle place but are we doing the exchange? If so sooner than later aka like now
Thanks bruh I couldn't remember
What's the China site we use to order jerseys???!
Are you guys watching this!?!?
@Logan Patiño @poonslayer where u at?
That's awesome though!!
I'm so mad we had to cancel :/ The meeting was really beneficial though so I had to!
WATWATWATWAT
This was a great season for all of us
Wait... it's over? Lol
😏
Nick I gotta say you're the only person I know how babes are literally lining up for
ONFG THAT WOULDVE BEEN PERFECT NICK
 Not helpful!
Pumpkin carving ideas!?
Guy on the left is given me that look
That's pretty neat!

I've slowly become the same way
Sweet! Please!!! And good work!! Are you a good public speaker?
Bro write down other people's topics for me!! I have to find a summary article for the class below me and I need more obscure topics with a good RCT or something on them!
GOOD LUCK!!
I spy a plain white mug
I'm coming to your actual seminar!!
At least we're beating Chicago :)
Ola >>> Kei
Thanks LoPa! I got it now
Probably not 😔
Anyone know if the crew playing on a channel I would have?
OMFG THIS ONE HAS A BLUE LOGO!!!
Then he isn't even a real drake fan.. probably likes the lyrically genius "Started from the bottom" and probably still thinks the song title is "started from the bottom now we're here"
Represent my 1% heritage
Haha I accept defeat
There we go! Logan gets it!
I'll be sure to keep you guys posted on all his jokes to come!! Stay tuned!!
"Torsades de pointe.. everybody wants that it's sexy! Nobody wants to be in a hospital and say Oh I have PAT w/ block" 😂😂 IM LTERALLY DYING
I want to be this guy! He's our kinetics teacher, works in the ICU, and there is an abnormal EKG on the white board from my cardio class yesterday and he just looks at it and goes "Oh, Mobitz 2!" And simply calls it out and keeps going he's genius
Look at that beauty
Sorry to hear that McCoy :/
Guys I just gave myself a fake insulin injection.. Like legit needle just had normal saline
SERIOUSLY!? That's awesome!
😂
Dr. Ohlinger
And that's the Microsoft word style option 
Casually holding his mug and teaching us pharmacokinetics... What a man
RIP
Recitation is a joke skip it
McCoy how's the Pokemon go up at MIT?
Because that picture you're in!?
It's the little things
Logan first can we take a moment to assess how genuinely happy you look after that hole in one? It's almost comparable to the bird from hackathon
THE MUG
I'm part of something now it's really simple measuring the "grit" vs performance in a Drug Lit class but I'm not sure if that will be a paper most likely a poster presentation at events
I wish I had a publication under my name it looks amazing for any resume/CV
That's awesome! When do you know what lab work?
McCoy my message didn't send yesterday because I have no service only wifi in the lab and with non iPhone I have to have service
I never reveal my sources 
So Nick you the APhA IPSF Junior Chair? Nice ;)
Mine are America
Send pics
But did you die?
I would say the stacked team has done what's expected of them yes
Pep >> Hart
Wrecked a charizard
Dang a full page over 1000! I just checked and I have 74 on the pokedex
Dang you're really moving up quick! Send your top Pokemon
With a lucky egg I can get to 55/75 experience needed to go to Lvl22
Level 21 as of today
Isaac my roommate lol
Just walked through main campus for 2.5 hours with Isaac and got like 18k just for catching Pokemon and poke stops and caught around 90 total
Don't feel bad Nick i wouldn't force anything
Details...?
I put it on after the game lol I put it on when I sent the pic
@Niel Skalican 😘
He left the room during our break and he brought the mug
It's just so beautiful like who has a plain white mug that literally holds like 2 sips of coffee 
You can see it there it's just so simple and beautiful
My professor has this plain white one cup coffee mug that I've never seen him without
Goodluck at MIT McCoy don't miss us too much 😘
God forbid*
Whether*
If I had the time I would I think David went to a few practices or something
http://youtu.be/oWK1b4ECMak 😘
Bear trap went off but there's no one there!
Watching the last Tranger Things right before bed might not be a good idea
Where you at Kei!?
@poonslayer When do you leave for MIT?
YEAH FRIG OFF!
Wait..

Gotta love these types of people
I'm sore
Yeah
Monica in Silicon Valley is in She's the Man
Park either at Logans or behind my car
Watching some She's the Man now but switching over at 10
Mine or we sneak into their's, steal food, then come back here your choice
Well Nick if you want to watch at 10 or anytime after or just enjoy your breakfast I'll be here watching
Like straight to the final?? How would that work in a bracket?
That way everything is competitive how we wanted
Or just play 5 teams and all games go to 25
David's partner is confirmed so with your parents we do have 6 teams
Is something happening with Pipa?
Do we have enough people yet?
They're insane! I was looking into "throws" and "catches" and I think it's anything that isn't clean off the palm and fingers flat
Also if I were to block a hit and it came on our side then we have 2 hits remaining and I am allowed to touch it next
If there is both teams touching it simultaneously at the net and it falls to my side then I get 3 hits still
If the ball is on the other side I can reach to block it ONLY after they made contact so think of it like pass interference in football the where they have to touch it then you can hit
USA USA USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Wow world record in men's 100 breast stroke by Great Britain 
Men's USA beach volleyball at 3pm
I'm eating and drinking coffee
What's back?
If Niel overslept let's push this back a bit!
Kill me no sleep
Which I'm tempted to do anyway to enjoy my coffee and not be up by 7 lol
I just need confirmation before I sleep soon and if not I am heading to the Patiño house between 10-11 with a 9:30 alarm
So I just got home and probably sleeping in my own bed for the night but I too would like to know some plans for tomorrow because if something is going down at 8 I need to be aware
Just listened to adventures of Bobby Ray for the past hour
Like I would know that lol
Good dick will do that 😂😂😂
McCoy I'm still laughing at your comment 
Past sunset :/
¿?
And...?
Get it boi
Just let me know what we doing! 7am is not my favorite I would say let me have some sleep
I like your idea Logan and early is fine with me on Saturday
Danggggg
A week day would be way better because the people and yeah an end of summer weekend will be packed
Like a weekday but work gets in the way
I mean.. We're basically loosing money if we don't go
Also you know how prescribing birth control is becoming the next big thing? Well all my grandpa can talk about and sends me emails of articles are things like the conscience clause of not having to dispense birth control if it's against my beliefs and in my head I'm like "it's the 21st century bruh"
Mhm! I love the increasing role of pharmacists but maybe this isn't the best thing
Sorry I texted that before I left work! I think it has its positives because wouldn't you want your kid or a loved one who accidentally overdosed or something to be saved but what I really don't like is it's basically an excuse for any opioid addict to go too far because they know it's just a drive into the nearest pharmacy to get it reversed
Nick your take on our narcan dispensing rights?
One more day right??
@Niel Skalican @Zach Spangler Sand volleyball tournament Sunday August 7th starting mid afternoon or so 
@Logan Patiño 107.9 the sickest radio mix rn tune in with DJ Snake
"Pretty chill" 😂
How was the trip!?!?
You guys driving now?
100% fake
Magmar
That's sweet! I did jetskis for the first time in Maumee and they were pretty fun they're so fast at accelerating and turning
I'll pack you some sandwiches
Yes please
U kno it
Traffic won't arrive till game time 😑
Toronto trip sounds freakin awesome and if it's a thing next summer by chance and I'm free then count me in
I'm not entirely sure about everything
No clue but it should in the near future f it isn't now since its on the main website
There's a way to change teams once if anyone is coming over to Instinct
What's the wildcard mean in fantasy?
Volleyball Tournament August 7th at Logan's house
Find and confirm a partner everyone in here is obviously invited
Lancaster is drowsy city
Nice boy that machop is still sweet 
That EEVEE IS INSANE!
However you do have your time in that picture as a nurse would
I don't believe it
Don't believe it
YOU PLAY!?
Who's is that??
For now keep upgrading
:))) We will own carrol!!
I think they will add it where you can join a different team
I am seeing that online
Maybe in the future they will let you change
I went yellow since Nick already was Lvl5!
Wow
@Zach Spangler Zach you need to get Isaac into Poke Go and we can take the gym in Carroll together all four of us
Dis boi 
Leaving
New time! McCoy we leave at 5:30!
What time will you be able to get there Craig?
YESH
I'm wearing gym shorts
Par 3
I'm wearing shorts and a tee
Golf at 5:30 with me McCoy and Nick
Aight we can leave at 5:15 McCoy
Is @Craig Casto coming? And @poonslayer when do you want to leave? I can drive
Is Craig coming? I'm going to eat first
We would end up leaving probably in 30 minutes
Today
@poonslayer 
I know McCoy is going to the gym at some point
I work 9-5:30 tomorrow so I will probably be sleeping at my house but I probably only need to be back at my house around 12.. If we meet from there I can delay my haircut and McCoy and I drive together
I have to get a haircut but I can plan to meet everyone there if we get a time!
I don't know a Kelly Hoffman and are we actually doing it!?
😂😂😂😂
Hmm... Let's go Red or Blue Squad
What are my options?
Lvl4
Craig get the game
Or should I wait for more?
That's what I plan
So press transfer on my bad pidgey?
Dang nice to know!
Cute
What does CP mean and what should I do with a pudgy?
Load
lol
Bro mine won't even old
Lit.
Watching the end of 8 mile.. It's lit
If everyone is down!
I like coffee
New wallpaper
Gay.. I was excited
I downloaded it and chose Charmander but now I can't even get back on because the servers
Haven't even been able to start!
You got the game!?
Downloading now...
My ideal deck was always all evee evolutions and that's it
I don't know if I should believe Craig or not
Haha 4 years straight I miss and I didn't even make it to Vacation this year
Yeah every year..
I work Saturday till 5:30 so probably will miss out on Nick's gpa's thing since we are moving Paul into his new place that day
I could go any time if you had a chance to join
I would be down for after 5 just a thought
With McCoy 
I was going to say Par 3 golf
Nick and Craig do you guys work this Friday?
😑
@Nick Casto  I'm trying to get Curtis to get Google wallet and pay you for both tickets right now
He's wondering how much per ticket and what section and if you can get anymore
They only have mine posted till the 16th
I'm not ignoring you I'm like 5 minutes from work to check the schedule lol
Who is the 5'8 kid we signed?? Any potential?
Same
Why?
I work that day
That's better
I lost track of this discussion... I will like all the messages I agree with
Game, set, match
Goodness why is everyone bitter
Yeah Tampa is pretty good
Niel, shut up.
I think half the time people know we don't have the audacity to call them out
I mean it's just so clean and perfectly executed
Zachary we call that tachycardia
Really!?
Mac and I go way back
I'll try my bestest!
9-5:30
I work but when I work this Friday I will mention to Nick to attempt to get someone to take it!
Ayo Nick! When is your Gpa's party!?
I was sad seeing Hungary lose... They were playing better all game but couldn't finish with a 1-0 and then the end Belgium scored 3 quick
Thought I would let you know :)
Yeah!!!
Nick I judged worked with Kelsey from ONU! She say she know you!
Steven Seagal
Chile manager
Fun af... Adds a whole new aspect I liked it
PLAYING SEAFARERS
YASSSSS ME TOOOOO
July 1st! Sleep over Saturday maybe!
YOU KNOW ME BOI!!! IVE BEEN DYING TO COME FOR 5 YEARS IF I CAN MAKE IT I WILL MAKE IT!
Shakiri is so sticky it's hilarious to watch
Watching now but they haven't shown a replay
I'm not :/
Scratch what I said.. Style points over all
I need to adopt a more conservative play style since I don't get to play as much nowadays and my stamina isn't the same lol
With Chile's 7-0 win I think this final could be good just unfortunately I would prefer the 3rd place match to be the final lol
Argentina is insane tho..
Watching the highlights from last night since I was studying for my final and Messi is insane we just couldn't keep up at all
I want to stream it
"Sloshing"
WHAT!?!?!?
Not me and yes
Hahahahahahahahahahaahahaha
Hahaha Bussy!?
@poonslayer
Please tell me your thoughts on this tumblr post
No but I have this
Hahaha Yes!!!! That's amazing!
Such a perfect way to describe it
YES!!!! He was awake but we didn't know 😂😂😂
Definitely watch JR's press conference! Shows the real JR not the one depicted in media
LOVE MY CITY!!!! Best day ever this is so unreal!!!!
Okay cool this will be interesting
Can I still play with you guys if I'm way behind?
Dang!! Imma be 2 weeks behind!!
F ME
F ME FORGOT A GAME IS ON
Maybe after school ends!
Nerd
Need
Question... What kind of game is runescape? Do we all play together online? And is it worth it?
Ball is life 
Low key wanted someone to shank him on his walk back
WHAT A GOOD NIGHT
Sameeeee
HERE WE GO
I am seeing this long game though with the fouls on their top players
I gotchu Craig I see it too
Cavs blowing this lead
Umm I liked him last game but he definitely plays scared and doesn't have that factor that lets him beat defenders
USA USA USA USA
Dang Kyrie is burning Curry already!!
Yeah but the atmosphere you'll be in would make the game 5x better
Luv u
Quick what is a streaming website!?
Male
Nah Kyrie
If I wasn't in school I would
Tampa 1-0 Cinci
Crew 4-0 Tampa
Cinci >> Crew <- Niel logic
#1 fan 😂😂
She means well hahaha
Thank you Logan I was afraid you would be mad but as long as you laugh then this was a success 😂
I feel mean but it is funny
https://www.facebook.com/SPORTbible/videos/1985558394923016/
Is this Julie or is it Julie!?
A trash can
I would pay $0 and expect a nice salmon dinner before the concert
100% agree I've probably seen some of those same videos.. Rapping is about auto tune and publicity
Good point
I would almost be afraid of the truth
Omg so true lol
I would go to Drake for a reasonable price
Not me
Sounds like a 21st birthday if you ask me!
Whatcha got planned??
Happy Birthday LoPa! 🤗🎂
Soo... USA #1
Your girl outta town and this kernel is staying with yall because it got kicked out. What you gonna do?
How's vacation so far!?!?
Did you pass Zach?
Do I just go to FS1.com or what!?
Have you guys been able to find USA and other Copa streams?
Wow McCoy you don't last long
Gettin it ;)
Get subway!!
Dang you close!!!
If it's meant to be then she will be there
Make sure Craig talks to the red head this year that's all I ask
No way!! So jealous
DO YOU GUYS LEAVE TODAY!?
That's true! Which I believe they will and tbh if we get out I am happy enough!
There's such a huge difference in the first touch between teams
That was a bad game I don't think we played well
Nah Bedoya kicked the ball 20 miles above the goal
WHAT A STRIKE
A few chances but set pieces have been insignificant and our best chance was a 25 yard shot by Dempsey
If we get dead last and lose all three then I will agree
Agreed
2-0 Yedlin handball resulting in James' PK goal
Hmm... Thoughts on handball?
Your Colombian anthem
McCoy and Logan do you guys know your national anthem by heart?
SHOUT OUT TO KICK NASTO FOR THE SICK JERSEY TO REP MY COUNTRY!
Who's stadium is this? Football I'm assuming?
GUESS WHOS GOT FS1!!! THANK THE LORD
Sometimes I wish you dead
Just checking if I'm dumb but USA plays tonight right?
Nice! So predicted to like it more than nationwide?? 
Logan how was your first day??
How much time?
Wait so when do we know if Crew play FCC?
Like I e never heard of them before
Are they a new team?
Haha So hate FCC is what I'm understanding here lol Another one of Niel's things to be different and think he's the heart and soul of Cinc"I"
Haha I don't know why FCC is a topic of discussion that's what I'm wondering lol
Is everyone a Cinci fan now? I think I will keep to the Crew
I was going to pick him up but he was 8.1!
Yeah they probably weren't happy about that but who cares
Nervous??
Logan does your internship start today or tomorrow?
So jealous! Yeah I'm definitely in
How was golf??
Haven't gone in over a year
Gosh dang it I hate all you I want to so bad
Jealous
And Niel captained Kei Kamara 😂😂 What a has been!
Umm... Logan just came back on McCoy??
About time our table looks proportionate
So far everyone winning this week is the underdog!
Craig wants it
Why is crew delayed??
I'm looking at them now and Nick and Craig are neck and neck and you and McCoy basically are too
About to take 4th place again after this week
This is Logan
Saw that one coming
HARD STICK
"I dare Ronaldo to go kiss Carasco's girlfriend right now" hahaha New favorite commentator whoever said that
But RONALDO
RONALDO FOR THE WIN
Yep... Fifth
They play it so safe!
Ronaldo probably wanted fifth shot
I sortve want Ronaldo to get one last award but as a team I want Atleti
😑
Who is everyone cheering for btw
Did you guys hear Alexis lalas before OT talking how if he heard the potential best player in the world was plying in this game he would expect at least one moment of brilliance? 
And did some creepy tongue thing
Pepe should have at least a yellow for two simulations where he rolls and holds his face
Now Modric is a boss.... His passes are so beautiful
When's the last time Ronaldo or Bale did something?
😳
Youre welcome
It's my channel 12 if that helps
I actually have it on my cable
DALÉ
I know who they should've got...
I'm banking on Ronaldo just going off in the beginning giving him the confidence he needs to wreck and go with the flair
Who watching the final?
Yea true I guess for starter clubs I would look for cheap and all the same brand/set
I say buy clubs fit for your height and clubs you can feel comfortable with! So before you guys get some make sure to test them out and be happy with them
Ma man ;)
It's the eyes that got you amirite?
Zach there are more important matters at hand rn
Pics 
Yee 
Actualy he said his foot is messed up
I think he's home already
Tell Robby D I say what up 🤘🏽
When everyone is out playing soccer and you're studying platelet disorders 😔
He's got probability control in a later click
I realized.....
Come over to Tottenham
I would help...
And it was awesome! Two 90 degrees drops and they make you hang over the edge before releasing you
Front row Valravn babeeeh
I always wondered why professionals in 2v2 sand volleyball never go for the dinker and now I know
YES NO GAY DINKERS!
I knew that was coming screw you Craigery!
Craig you better mean me
Thanks guys! Going with Raheem the Dream today
D-FENCE WINS GAMES CRAIG
I know! Like what the heck who spends that much and goes through all that for just my birthday! My parents don't! Lol
This event is so boring omg
Deal :)
Jealous
Wow
SOA-CAO-TOA!!! 😂😂😂😂😂 still laughing at that 
Hey Niel my Pride team went like 13-1 one year!! We probs could wreck the Crew!!
David and I are home 
+ spike ball
I won't be here for my birthday though
I think I am going to eat with the family for my birthday tonight around 6ish
Wednesday is my last night in the 740 boi
I'm a better hiker 
March Madness is a thing?
Oh.... Wyatt seems to think you only need above a 2.0?
And is it different than what you need to stay in the program?
Nick what do you have to keep in ONU pharmacy to graduate?
YESSSS
Or "as all Cleveland fans say"
As all great fans say: there's always next year
Wowow
I just saw the score thinking they already knew they couldn't win but keep their spot
IT DROPPED THEM A SPOT!?!? WOWOWOWOWOW 
Also underrated
Underrated 
Wtf?
😔
☺️
Does she hate me?
Haven't read anything but as long as it is here I am happy
Send pics I don't have a Twitter 
Don't say his name
Eh
And a bad attitude
Paul said we got money and a first and second round pick
Look for 4 defenders worth 75k a piece and keep Parkhurst for a substitute
See I will take the money... Buy a new defense 😂
How much did we pay him and how much did we get?
That's all I am hoping for!!!! My whole philosophy outside of his attitude is make money off him while the old man is still worth something
NE Revolution!
See ya later Kei!! 
Last night we went through two boxes of wheat thins, a box of cousin willies, ice cream, 4 turkey burgers and buns, McCoy made two chicken breasts, made pancakes, omelettes the past two mornings and then I come home and take a fourth cup of my mom's "gluten" free granola stuff and she flips.... This is why the sleep overs don't take place at my house lol
Yeah
Zach 😢😢😢😢
Guess who's back?
I have a passport!! It's just about my availability but Toledo is already half way there in a way!
Hahha I was going to say Passports are very official documents you won't get that in a week
Technically I just finished my four year degree 😳😳😳😳
 IM DONE
Send pics
I wonder if closer to the time we find a meeting point to drive there
Are you Lakewood or west lake?
I'll be in Euclid, OH from the 25th of July to August 9th I think
Wait actually Nevermind I will be coming from Cleveland area from an internship
Haha It's like a win-lose but I mean I know what the right choice is here! Maybe my dad lets us take the excursion up so everyone can ride together! It fits 8!
So.... To unfortunately hit you guys with some bad but good news... As you all know my birthday is May 20th and as you all know Paul's birthday is June 8th so as a combined gift and they brought David in as well my parents bought us tickets around the half field line about 13 rows up.... Since Curtis bought a ticket too I think his cousin is buying mine from me 
👍🏽
How much is each???
Hey Nick do I still owe you for mine and Curtis' tickets?
It won't post!!

Dang!! Logan has an awesome in!
NO WAY!!! Dang you guys do it a year earlier than us!!
Btw everyone.. I now officially can give everyone their immunizations
Oh my bad I did say free lol
Free? They are 37 including tax lol Which saves $35
I'm gone all through late May and June so just an offer for free tickets.. If we get enough people then I'm all in but it's up to you guys
I could do between the 10th and 19th
For any time in May
When are we going to Cedar Point? Today is the last day for $30 tickets
Sum 41 is like one of Paul's favorite old bands and they may have changed their name
All the sudden I've presented like 3 times in the past month
Do you guys ever have to present in front of your class??
I was going to say! We learned that this year Emily was impressed you knew that!
That gon be me someday
Who here still likes watermelon after realizing it looks like an ascites patient's stomach
My girl works it on the weekends
Use your words McCoy.. You got this
It begins
What's Dean lost qualification?
Not sure about that Niel!
That's just for now!!! And it's a class with multiple finals in different areas so I need an 89 average on them all
Yeah just took a final... Already know I missed 2 points 😑
Niel has two wins..... Both against me
Just followed Jim Stopani on Facebook and he literally has a bunch of videos that are so helpful!! Like who knew the tricep kick back as awkward and non engaging as it is is actually one of the best tri work outs!
KICK NASTO FOR THE WINNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!
Dis them back!
I found a new shout at Hong Kong Buffet
Yeah Craig she also does stuff with TB!!
Haha You're exactly right Poonslayer!!! Like it's all about prevention and detection and just how insane would that be!!!
So much more interesting than studying PPIs leading to C. Diff lol
Not saying I wouldn't apply to join that lab...... I would be all about that!
My new MedChem teacher is from MIT and she was telling us how people in the lab above her at MIT studied biological weapons and we're looking into Zika as a weapon 😳
4/20
Haha He's beating Niel tho
I have Cash app :)
Random though: Craig I still owe you $4 for pizza... Don't let me forget
Dumbbb
A tie!?!?
Not looking good for me...
https://media0.giphy.com/media/xTiTnBVEew0rLWXXqw/giphy.gif
How many points off the bench coming?
How much??
Seriously??
Dang now I'm worried!!!
Well I captained Castillo also so it's based on Urruti and Dwyer against my Dia (SKC Defender)
Oh shoot!!!
Dom Dwyer needs to pull around 10 points for you to win Craig!
And currently Niel is living up to his reputation 8-40
28-19
Currently Nick may be leveling the scores in MLS
I only shed one tear
I thought I was the chosen one but there was only so much I could do in 5 weeks... I made the executive decision last night as I chose sleep over managing my line up
I am sorry to all of my supporters, but I hereby declare myself dropping out of the race to beat McCoy in fantasy this year. It has been a fun run 😪
Wait is Craig actually doing that to his car?
That's awesome!!! About time we get some drama going!!
Just talked to someone about Black Cherry keyboards
I played to day with medical students and I think I counted 5 megs and messed up 2 so 5/7
Craig I respect you so much more I didn't know he was your favorite too!!
Second favorite player to ever play the game! Only to Tmac
Same.. I have two class presentations tomorrow but no way I missed this
Best possible way to remember him
Wowow
Carrying the Lakers like the last 20 years!
I LOVE THIS MAN
I could never miss this!!! It's insane!!!!!
I am!!!!
Craig I gave you a 4 point lead because my substitutions.. Better take advantage
It just goes to show
https://www.facebook.com/GeeksterInk/videos/1080983495273810/
@poonslayer 
May 20 I move back I think
I be home 2nd week of May or so
🙋🏻 pleasant valley
Oh wow they just bashed on Yedlin hard for Vardy's first goal and well deserved too
Jk
I was literally coming back into group me to say except the goalie lol
Sunderland just gave up with like 10 minutes left in the game.... Almost embarrassing to watch I hope they get relegated
Go ahead
CREW SC BABY!!!! WE DA BESS!
Still have this shin splints? :/
Ur hot
Thanks boo 😘
Of course I forgot to trade out Keane 
No :/ I wish... It would be fun between all us though
SERIOUSLY!?!? My gosh I never knew this I just played the first time last night
It's fun af
😑
WELL DO YOU OWN IT!?!?
YOU KNOW IT!?
Anyone ever hear of a board game called Catan???
Play the first 2 moves of heroclix 
In that case if you guys don't mind I might drive down to chill for 15 minutes or so
Pics
How are everyone's manbuns coming?
Either way that's kinda sweet! You could join the crew and annoy Logan and McCoy with drug talk 👍🏽
No shame in that though! Money is money
Like some manufacturers research and invent/create their own drugs and make a patent for them and others just make the cheaper generics which are the exact same and market them once the brand name patent expires
Hope that turns out though! What would you do for them???
I think they're the type to just put out a bunch of generics and get rich lol
Ye
We actually were forced to and got classes cancelled to be there but I would've probably gone anyway it only happens at places like once every 7 years or so! So basically lucky
Second person was applying for intern license but stole a phone charger so they had to go through all the crap to give him his license 😑
PharmD
She just got sentenced to 5 year probation and has to go to PRO (pharmacist rehabilitation organization) for that time but she still has her license so she's lucky and probably because she wasn't under the influence at work
Currently at a pharmacy hearing where this girl could get her license revoked for alcohol and heroin abuse
Keane is out which hurt me
Nick our game was embarrassing... When I logged on just now I saw how horrible my team did like 2s and 3s everywhere but then turns out we both did haha
Deli Alli just joined the F2 freestylers and now they call themselves F3!
Exactly.. Like that's the perfect word
So like Megan Trainer is chubby but not fat.. I don't know how to categorize
AND PAYET'S FREEKICK 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
SECOND AND FOURTH***
WHO SAW MAN CITY'S FIRST AND SECOND GOALS
Dang Craig ;)
Anyone know the time of the game?
And yeah I think they would almost be on eternal strike if that's their plan
If they charged more money (team/manager pays them more money) then their sales won't catch up and almost every team will go under
How many tickets are you able to get?
Let me see her
No I did not!
The Bickle again?
Who's your bae Craigy?
👍🏽
Yessir
^Curtis
🙋🏻
Will do!
Nick when should Curtis know by?
($11)
Could I get 0.0055% ownership please?
By tonight I will tell him to make up his mind
Curtis might be buying one but he isn't decided
I'm still in whenever I set up Google wallet I will send it
🙋🏿
I just feel there's a difference between the surface and say 3 inches in for my case (jk this is not for me asking to do it but the 3 inches is correct)
So it's like a shower before kind of event? What about all up in there
Learning about bacteria and the idea came up of anal and I'm curious the group's thoughts on how long one would wait between having anal and the girls last poop
On the game
What's the date?
Collecting 20 of those stupid things in oblivion had me so underpaid
Nirnroot cures cancer it's a fact
Just think... 7 hours non-stop alchemy
I feel like running from my responsibilities and playing Skyrim
Adventures of Bobby Ray and Finally Famous albums for studying = heaven
And yeah McCoy has 2015 Fifa belt and SOCCER Classic! Can't let him own 2016!
I have a lot of trades too it's just about my captain picks
Hahaha I'm trying to hard!!! This past week I set myself up for it
I just need Niel to win lol A 4-0 start for McCoy is getting away too quick 
I have Castillo just because he has a double game week
Obviously you know my captain but honestly that captain pick scares me a bit because typically when Giovinco plays well he scores close to 15 
@Nick Casto Can I know your captain?
Craig that's beautiful! 
Craig averages just shy of 60 a match but just can't get it lol Consistency will pay off though
McCoy I truly am sorry but I am cheering for Nielson
Some good match ups this week! If Niel can pull an upset like he did on me, tie breaker between Nick and me, and if Craig beats Logan there will be a 2 or 3 way tie for last
He does all the car singing things
He's so funny.. Maybe one day you guys will catch on lol
😞
Who likes James Corden?
Just remember in anatomical position the penis is erect
CRAIG WITH THE GRAMMAR CORRECTION 🙀🙀🙀🙀
@Craig Casto The song Kevin on Macklemore's new album is good and so real.. Nick would understand it
Zayn's new album: 👍🏽 or 👎🏽
Dang you Niel I wanted to pass you
Who has Duke over Oregon and TAMA winning tonight?
I gotcha.. And Alex and I thought Mia would be funny
Honestly I was able to predict probably half of all your picks.... Only thing I was shocked by is Jennifer Lawrence not in McCoy's
Hard to do mine....
1. Brittany Snow (It's just gotta be)
2. Emma Watson
3. Ariana Grande
4. Anna Kendrick
5. Shakira

Honorable Mention: Mia Khalifa
@Niel Skalican I LOVE AND RESPECT YOUR REESE WITHERSPOON PICK
Can someone find out what tickets cost??
Hahaha Like she's some random girl in pharmacy
Do I correct her?
Possible scores are all quite close!
By 4 points brah! But all the games were within 5 points this week!! I'm excited for this fantasy! The BPL is closer than ever too
Hahaha That's why I want them out!
Also Nick can you kick Merseyside and Red Devils for me? They don't play
DID NICK CASTO JUST TAKE FIRST PLACE THIS SEGMENT!? 
I have like a week or two right when summer starts that I will be home!!
Love you
McCoy is deciding factor
Except Logan and Niel good job 
Wow to all of you
You're all liars
Who here flosses regularly?
Hahahaha Nick the celebration made it 😂
You guys have Dayton or Syracusev
The only thing I saw was "oh Arizona has a team to shock people and go far" so I put them to elite 8 and they lose by 10 first game
School is my captor 😞
Dang Microsoft word is healthier than I am logging its macros
Possibly? I think like an unofficial one
At least for another 7 minutes till the game starts 
Stay strong Nick!
App idea #10: Phone that locks you out of all things except calls to make you focus and not check your phone too much and it does like 50 minutes locked, 10 minutes unlocked 
Dang Niel! 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 😚
You aren't even good
YAS
Like it would be sweet if I could put a white self changing writing on my current screen saver....
Logan app idea: I like to have a "to do list" as my lock screen wallpaper however I hate making a new one in my ugly looking notepad, screenshot the updated one, then reset it as my lock screen so if an app looked clean and did all that and updated your lock screen at the same time as updating the list.... I want part of the money you make from this golden idea
YES
In the moment you will regret that but long term you won't 👍🏽
Hmm.. Why not haha
Is she hot?
Hahaha You have two trades to correct 34 points to 79
And I'm sorry I didn't get to weigh in on picking on Niel.. 
But bring it on this week boi
Niel you're so white
Florida! No tv!
No freakin way I am literally dying not watching
WHAT HAPPENED I NEED DETAILS
What's my name for it?
Nick I love how you still used a comma regardless of how angry you were lol
Ha
Sorry I have this group on silence since it can go off repeatedly at some bad times (the one exam I forgot to turn my phone off don't worry it was vibrate at least) but I can't tonight! Probably not till Wednesday
I didn't think so lol
Logan you play?
Same
He's like 2 years old
I be in Florida for spring break
Shoot... Only chance you have is on the computer like Zach
Oh... PS3 right?
But the real question is do you have a PS4?
When's the last time we've seen you?
Just wait till we have tourney's at Logan's on weekends over summer
DID YOU GET ROCKET LEAGUE YET
No no like the fantasy one
Nick change the name of our group!!
And why does it look like a rec league jersey..... Like the kind where it's 2 dollars more to get two different colors on your shoulders for the generic jersey that anyone could make and basically all teams would use
I still have to do it and that Jersey/crest combo is horrid 
NICE!!!! About time the crew becomes more visible and not using sketchy sites just to watch them in 120p 
What's the Crew and CW thing?
😂
No clue she just saw a picture of Parkhurst and said she likes him... It's a start I will take it lol
Emily's new favorite player is Michael Parkhurst
Oh wow
If you as my it was a pretty perfect pic on my part 😎
No no like I 100% back my opinion regardless of who I am a fan of! As long as Barca defense keeps holding up they really won't be beat especially in a two game series
And Barca is going to win it all I already know it... MSN is unstoppable
What you guys talkin bout??
Nah I feel everyone else we bring in drops out too quick...
Emily doesn't know anything about soccer and played when she was 7 😂
She say she cute&fabulous22@aol.com
Brianhoffman2012@gmail.com or you can reach me at soccerprincess12@aol.com
Because Elizabeth Hurley..
Wait is that Bedazzled!?!?!?!?
Haha Yeah I realize it was the 17th but still!! And nope I don't have the money to spend on video games when Curtis already has a PS4
ROCKET LEAGUE FOR XBOX ONE TODAY
He called the cops 😂😂😂
Oh Logan by the way.. Today I had to work and I was just doing a transfer (talking on the phone to some pharmacist at Kroger receiving a prescription for a patient to fill at my store) and I was simply going through all the things I needed for them and then I said "What was the original date of the prescription?" And she goes "6/12" and I go "Oh that's Logan's birthday".... So we both paused.. 10 seconds go by and I just go "bye" and hang up 😂😂😂😂😂 Most awkward thing ever I panicked and didn't know what to even say and even forgot to ask when they last filled it
And she's very pretty Craigy... If only you knew how to park
"Dated"
Daddy
DM me them
I'm interested Nick
Consider every message from Nick "liked" by me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I like the family is everything statement because technically I consider you guys family as wel and look how much it sucks to hear people all living in different areas and then look how weird it would be not seeing like Paul and David for months at a time... But also I like traveling and new experiences and want to be open to change
I feel everyone is kinda set on their own opinions already haha 
#FingersInTheBootyAssBitch ☝
Your move Nick
no thanks
What is it?

HOW ADORABLE IS MY PROFESSOR!?
To clarify that is "suck" not something else..
Going to sleep tho.. Nick you da mayne! Welcome to the 21+ club everyone else can $uck it
I will send a pic next time I do it... It will be glorious
HAPPY BIRTHDAY NICK!!!!!!!!
RIP in peace, mustache
Had a hella good mustache going over the weekend where I shaved everything else bare but now it's time for school tomorrow and I had to let him go.. 😞😞
Wow Nick I didn't know you knew so much about fashion
Dang Nielson... Looking good 😏
yep
https://media3.giphy.com/media/3o85xsOgW1aDjUQLkI/giphy.gif
Pochettino my hero
LLORIS LITERALLY JUST GOT LIKE A CONCUSSION TO WIN THAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yep! Long time!
She was one of Tatum's good friends
She do
Proba Ashtyn
WOOOO
I'm happy you guys like him :) Respectable young lad he is
What a cutie
LETS GO TOTTENHAM
Wow
Look at Bolt Speedman fly past everyone and score back post!
Is that yo!?
I saw he got subbed in and was shocked I had no clue he transferred
McCoy leads with 10 points lol
This fantasy week has been very dry throughout the first half
You look like a lumberjack
Gotcha! I don't listen to either anymore they both trash!
Yeezy is Kanye? Or Wayne?
I've watched it 5 times
https://www.facebook.com/LiamDineen/videos/577213465796036/
Please tell me you guys are able to watch that lol
I only do anal
Nice ;)
My MedChem teacher said it's spreading by the thousands in Brazil... Luckily we are in the winter while it's the outbreak so mosquitos are a huge deal
Yeah it's all fine very light symptoms (possible rare severe neurological symptoms) but mostly just microcephaly in newborn babies if a girl gets it while prego! So just try not to knock up Julie or Lexi till they figure this thing out and we good!
It's in Cleveland so Logan don't die over the summer
Two words: Zika Virus
You posted the logo and said "I'm so excited for this season" and I was worried we were switching to that!
Nick what the heck is that?
Ascaris lumbricoides ☺️
Dang I wish we all could go get one together 
Anything
Yep! No spaces
Emily
Wait for it... Maybe use a capital R she left that part out
And tell Julie too
Text "raincheck" to 888-222 for a free chipotle burrito 
I just cracked the 1400s! So proud :)
Wowowowowow
That goal... Wow
I'd kiss Isaac
AYYYYY!!!! This Trippier guy has been crucial today! He's good af on the wing
He just got subbed on! It's game time now!
Hey Niel.. Thomas is still beating you over all and he hasn't played for 5 weeks 😮
They don't play each other for a while so we will never know
Not today though! I think Tottenham could do it
You're wrong Logan
Tottenham has 12 goal attempts to Watfords 1 in the first half
Also who do you think would win between Leicester and Tottenham rn
How has Tottenham not scored yet... I'm getting annoyed 
He's not wrong 
Wow.. My idol
Did they play the song!?
Like x5000^^^^
Winner keeps Lexi... Let's raise the stakes
Nice lawyer persuasion skills though... That earned you like +2 persuasion levels if this were Skyrim
I would've made him a cup of tea.. Talk about love and what life could really be me
Julie told me this morning actually.. I didn't know what to say so I was going to wait till you guys were ready... I'll miss the little weirdo.. The strangest most lovable dog ever
When it looks to your standard
Craig I say you've come this far just hold off from putting it into a bun until it's ready
😂
I will call it for the night the Internet is all messed up lol
Hahaha Nick GPA doesn't make you a good pharmacist! 
I've often thought about the possibility of opening a pharmacy with David after I had years of work and making my own money... Nick join in
True that to Nick! They're expanding a lot of what we do!! I swear every year I hear of one more thing we can "prescribe" because they realize we know twice as much as any doctor when it comes to meds AND are taught diagnosis and disease states in school
Because we've got doctorate degrees ;)
What game is that?
You the boy Craig!
I have to trade out an 8.8 De Bryune with 1.0 free already AND all the top midfielders are playing like crap except Mahrez who has a tough streak of games coming up... What is life
Screw De Bryune
You guys all just say the sweetest things :)
😢🔫
Don't I have 5 midfielders too? So no subs lol
He's out??
Oh god who did I pick?
What's that
I say yes to greatest all time and yeah Nick I started watching towards the end of Jimmy's time but they have a good outlook at things! I don't watch them all though
I think it would be cool to see Messi in the Prem but he doesn't have to prove himself in my eyes.. That replacement for Jimmy Conrad made it really clear in one of his videos
Yeah or my boy
NEW YEAR NEW TEAM
Zardes looks dead
And I just like Finlay's work ethic and 110% all the time
USA passing in general looks really good
AYYYYY
I hope berhalter is watching
;)
Aight
Do we like Acosta??
I want to make my 3-1 score prediction more specific.... Kristinn scores their goal
They are really praising altidore
Hahaha Oh wow I really need to up my testosterone levels
Hahahaha No I swear!!! 
Hahahaha Literally for 10 minutes only it was that or bowling!!
Watching keeping up with the kardashians until 4 as has been great
I don't know him or Acosta
Thanks bruh
Shoot I don't have one! Can you post a pic?
Where you seeing the lineup?
Head to head for sure! Free for all is what premier league is for
So.. MLS fantasy or na? 
That would be awesome.. Finally bringing defenders over! And 3-1 USA
Literally listening to that album now hahaha
Gotta get my Gyasi jersey on mane!!!
What time/channel?
☺️
😢
You've grown up so fast 😢😩
Happy Birthday McCoy! 
Me
ya
I'm obsessed with JB and 1D albums on repeat back and forth
Hahaha Ties into our point made a long time ago that Brazilians peak early lol
You sure you're looking at the right guy?
Wait...
37
That's why I think it's an awesome idea! Whether instead of Myrtle or additional to Myrtle
True about hiking being extremely cheap!
Hiking and camping even for an extended weekend when I'm actually home could be fun........ 
Anyone actually hear anything about Falcao lately??
There better be some sweet chili Doritos 
When and where?
😉
Like the FIFA tournament this year?
Hahaha The day you two get married I am going to sit him down at a table and tell him what I really have thought of him all these years.. He will have no choice but to adopt me and be my best friend
My boi Rob and I reminiscing 
Joined the crew with Kathmandu
And dang I thought I had a good app idea!!
She claims that she didn't cry when I texted her telling her you wanted to kiss her and then it all was a lie... BS
Hey app idea....
What if when someone leaves a voicemail the same operator system that converts words to text when you're driving converts their words to text from a voicemail but obviously able to listen as well
BAM
Nick, you and I are mentioned and your part with he words "pointlessly lies" literally made me laugh for 3 minutes
Nice Avi
I read it right when it was posted haha
Just went 7-0 by myself in online 3 player rocket league 😎
Soccer? Mine is channel 20 on regular buckeye cable or whatever
How do we know you're not isis, Nick?
Nah
Wouldn't mind an Arsenal goal
Maybe Chelsea is a part of isis... Costa definitely seems dirty enough
Suck it
I wonder if anyone has Mertesacker on their team
Not watching the game 😞
Hahaha Thank you McCoy.. 
Stupid Arnautovic not playing
I watched second half.. Logan...... If your captain pick was Firmino then you would easily take a comfortable lead in fantasy
CRAIG OMG CECH IS A MONSTER!
The second he scored I said "Dangit Logan"
ROONEY!!!
I would rather lick his deltoid than her nip.. Just sayin
His shoulder is bigger than her boob.. 
So much so I liked my own comment
10/10 would bang..
DID SOMEONE SAY DISCOUNT!?
Anyone have Ward-prouse?
SAME
I refuse to pick up Wijnaldum because I think he is only going to play well for a little longer but so tempting
And there's no way he is already silver!!
Wait you have it!?
Just reached Silver 1 for the first time
Nice!!!
McCoy and Logan did you guys yard expand??
I had a notification!!! Good stuff!
Hey I have this chat muted just because in-class purposes but someone try to @ me so I can see if it goes past the mute in case you have to get a hold of me
1%
Up to you guys! And I have been getting on Tumblr more ever since its been on my phone ☺️
I'm afraid to check the scores on ESPN
Who's that?
I would be up for a sick computer when I'm older and out of college! For now I stick with my 360 and that's it
PS4 is a waste of money in my opinion I only agree with a new gaming system in Logan and McCoy's case where they traded in about $300 worth or more of stuff
Then use his??? Rocket League is only $20
Does Donnie have one? And sorry I don't have time lol
So Messi with a 5th ballon D'or by a long shot
Plus they might eventually figure out the link between PC and PS4 in rocket league!
Tempting honestly but since I'm not buying any new counsel or game I wouldn't
Ready for some rocket league!?
Jealous... How's the PS4 process?
Maybe college just sucks
Oh that happened to me over a year ago when I never received mine
Hahaha Nice Nick
And Logan you would just have to get it from her but that's the easiest and I don't trust shipping
Logan how do you want FIFA 16?? Shipped or give it to Sarah wood who is coming to Toledo for this upcoming weekend and then leaving to go back home (taking a semester off and no she's not coming to see me)
Well did they at least make some money off of Jmac?
First class syllabus lasted 5 minutes exact
Expansion!!!
Watching Harold and Kumar on tv and guess what word I see
Can you blame him?? She's worth some jail time
She hot?
Thanks boo
Nick on my way to your house
Okie!
Nick do you know when you will get to Meier with the box??
Welp I will find a place to get that box from ya
Please do! But I was hoping but I have to do school stuff this weekend 😩
Wait you weren't talking about hanging today?
Oh... I would drive to your house possibly
This evening
Haha I don't need that 😂
YES!!! Please bring it!
Weird question but I am really hoping
Nick do you have a FIFA 15 box at your house that I can have and I will get you mine from school?
He is going out to get something but will be back within an hour or two
I'm already at LoPa!
Today 😩
Yeah boi!
You have some good lighting.. As in Christmas lights
10/10. Would bang.
Haha That last place person!
Yessir!
Logan/Zach I'm leavin now
Blue USMNT Zardes jersey long sleeve from Nick
I bet you get your sterling before I get mine! 😂😂
It's very high quality!!
Aight
Sooner the better
Yessir
@Zach Spangler is Rocket League happening tomorrow?
Oh wow.. Congrats 
What's that?
Please bring it!! I've been looking at paddles all yesterday and I feel I've found one but I want to see how his plays before I commit
Yeah! That could be fun! Do you have Craig's old AliExpress paddle??
I might chill at Logan's and play ultimate team or have them here and play ping pong and like always everyone is invited haha
Just curious.. Are we ever getting those nudes or no?
I'm good with both!
Who feels like we should do one massive 500 point game heroclix on a small map?
Niel when is next year's person getting their jersey??
Niel when am I getting my jersey??
It usually just allows you at some random time this week
Tuesday I have to do school stuff
I vote Wednesday 
So who we got for Tuesday Star Wars???
Hmm.. Is Chelsea bouncing back??
Ye
I now follow Nathalie on tumblr
Are you doing the FIFA tournement!?
Poor Nick
Bring Nick's
Another year without my jersey
I would say come around 10
Nick I'm excited for your arrival in the morning ☺️
That's for children
Yessir!
I will probably set my alarm for whenever 7.5 hours of sleep is
Whenever
@Craig Casto 
@Craig Casto 
That's fair^^
Ping pong and iron site too
The biggest tourney of the year
Why though.. You said Saturday 
HE MUST COME
HE LIVES
Oh man! Coffee, heroclix or even morning hot tub!
Plus the draft will take an hour at least I'm sure of that
Heroclix ping pong and iron site
We can always Heroclix before everyone comes
If so the earlier we start the better
Well Ninny and Pop are going to be there tomorrow night right?
12AM
Nick you a for sure not coming tonight?
Sounds perfect! We are writing teams down and then all share at the same time and if there are any duplicates you play a game to decide the person who gets it
Why not?
Yee
Get off summer school end of June
I just asked someone the approximated date since he's a year older
And Craig you're coming no dumb excuses you're part of the group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEpDTJF-JzE
Nick's bread and butter
Night of January 1st is the FIFA tourney
😂
You know.. This might be my favorite Tumblr post of all time
Yeah we do and everyone said it messes it up
That's why I haven't got it
Does it mess everything up?
Wasn't sure if it was worth it or not lol
Logan, did you download El Capitan?
33 almonds = 0.1 lb
Which mall?
I've had a loootttt of downtime lol I can watch the 5th if you guys are going 4-6 then 1-3
I've watched the 1st through the 4th Star Wars already 😂
During or after what?
Well we should hang
What's everyone up to today?
😢
McCoy, got your jersey yet?
s'sorry I can't 
THATS FREAKIN AWESOME
Something like this?
That's a fair question.. 
Merry Christmas fam 🎄🎄
Oh just some model chick
Craig AE has your perfect girl
I work 9-5pm on the 2nd 
They are going to try and win a title with DP players only
Traded Marcelo -> Sucked
Trading Omar and Juninho -> F me
Send me
I want to sleep for 24 hours
Wait McCoy did you get your jersey?
I will when I see yo next I don't have that app
Brianhoffman2012@gmail.con

I will send it to David
Got the gloves on our way
Meet us at the turf
Don't forget cleats! We are thinking of kicking it around now also bring a ball if you want a specific one for golf
Heck yeah!
I'm ready whenever
When would you come Nick?
What if we got the tournament draft started??
Wait Logan did you get a Lukaku last year?
Hahaha It would be the same story as Raheem leaving
Goodbye Omar 😢
I just passed them!!!
I might come over a bit later then!
What are you guys doing tonight?
Dang
Anyone want to shoot around on Logan's net?
I'm up to hang both nights though
Why give presents if you're ending it?
Tbh.. I think Philippines deserved it... Did you see the rack on that girl!?
HAA JK THEY READ IT WRONG AND TOOK THE CROWN BACK FROM COLOMBIA AS SHE ALREADY CELEBRATED IT AND GAVE IT TO THE GORGEOUS FILIPINO!
Colombia wins miss universe!
You alright?
Logan's homemade recipe
Haha You never should've told us that..
Congrats mane!
:)
Wait what!?!? YESSSS
Everton is in form and is good and there was just something about Martinez talking about his defense 
SCREW U MCCOY!!! MAHREZ WAS MY AUDACIOUS CAPTAIN PICK!
What about the 24th?
With what?
If that worked then I would rather not do the morning to have everyone here
Also I want to work something out I'm just saying we aren't good at planning and commiting so that's the most fair way if we don't get this figured out
Only thing I can think of is do both events back to back on the 23rd after 3pm and just not do the Classic in the morning
Hey guys I think if we don't figure all this out then we should hold off on the FIFA tourney and just have the Christmas Eve Classic at 9am on Christmas Eve like always until we get people to commit to other options
Sooo have we figured the 23rd out yet?
Literally any time that day! That's why we thought to knock both out in the same day so we make sure everyone is there
What about at night though?
7 person round robin on the 23rd! Soccer golf in the morning and tourney at night! Please everyone drop plans and come!
And AM is soccer golf and PM is tourney
And Nick right?? Nick you good!?
Wait Craig are there goals up??
No I meant that's how long it takes you to do those two things lol I am just going to get my stuff on and come over
So 2 hours 😂
I haven't done "activity" in 2 weeks
When should we go?
YAS
TAS
Whenever we hear from Logan
ha
Wait would they have nets up for us??
Shoot!! 
Logan?
Nick will drive home rn and meet us
Yeah!
We got one!
😳
Soccer at the turf could've been sweet!
😞
Who wants to do something today!?
Haha Not your fault just checking! 
Who doesn't have their jersey and when are we all hanging out?
Logan I don't think you heard me earlier but I shared with the group how good Jake Miller is and I figured you would have agreed
Hey
We might be in that now
We on back roads some how
Haha We literally passed the campus 😂😂 I'm so lost!
Just got off at the ONU exit nick 
So we are currently on our way home and David is driving and I forgot to tell him our exit so we are literally almost at ONU but I haven't told him I completely messed it up
My house! And I have the belt packed!! On my way!
The similarity factor is a logarithmic reciprocal square root transformation of the sum of squared error and is a measurement of the similarity in the percent (%) of dissolution between the two curves
I totally forgot how good Jake Miller is
Did they already give you a scholarship??
Niel I'm so sorry your 4.0 was just overshadowed by McCoy lol You're still smart to lol
SO PROUD!!
2
Those are the days I can't but they aren't even next to Christmas Eve so that shouldn't be a problem
I am in Cleveland the 19-22
Niel awesome work
I am okay with moving the SOCCER Classic if needed but everyone better have their Santa hat and be ready for hot tub after
And we have had no movement on our drafting FIFA tourney however it needs to be played
NICE
Why is Kristinn still my Avi?
Craig I'm taking that back to where it belongs!! Be ready to hand it back to the true owner
No surprise you liked your photo
ESPN scores are all out of whack right now
MINE CAME IN TODAY MY DAD SENT ME PICS AND ITS MUY BUENO!
Craig... 2 in a row.... I will let Logan or McCoy the true "Colombians" have your head for this one
Craig I thought your GroupMe account was hacked and then I noticed the misspelled word
I always enjoy Zach's words of wisdom
Having a girlfriend be like
https://media2.giphy.com/media/a2f8mOunuMjjq/giphy.gif
Hahaha Nick and Barry at the same time.. Fight to the death
Call me Lance Armstrong
Am I a bachelor?
She's typically a good sport
I would just punch her in the teeth and she would understand
🔥🔥🔥
Me too
Whatever he's got against anyone I still agree with what Nielson says
I also think that is crossing the line I almost would rather have them text flirty than hang out and do stuff together.. I believe before break is the best time to end things if you were going to because then you have a month home with your family and friends to take your mind off everything
Yee
Why you a push over?
Thata boy Craig :) Accompanied by some ladies I assume
Should be studying for finals but I'm on Tumblr
Haven't gotten mine either
1. I agree with Logan and Niel
2. She chose to do long distance and take the risk whether it was her chance to attempt to move on or just start fresh but it is clear now she hasn't done either
3. Niel I'm coming to you more if I have girl problems 😂
Not her
Whoever said that it should be you doing the thinking of break up I agree
I wouldn't let her take advantage of you either.. If she still loves her ex then there is nothing she can say that should justify her hanging out with him (and hiding him) and my opinion is take control of the situation 
I don't think I could say it any better than that... I agree with everything Niel says
That is messed up.. If by now she still can't get over her ex then that's a problem especially if she tries to hide stuff from you
What's there to explain? I thought we all shared in this friend group! Just like Julie and Zach!
I would dunk on Lexi EVERY time she walked by that
I was wondering the same thing...
Like a 5 year deal
I remember you saying that lol
That's pretty sexy
I get two this year 😎
IM SUCH A LOSER I HAVE SPENT ALL MORNING CLASHING WITH THE MASSIVE NEW UPDATE 😂😂😂😂
Way way better
Wow I don't even know you guys...
Might be the worst song ever
Goodluck! I kept telling all my P1s that the best way they can prepare for the finals is to have a good grade going into them lol
It will happen! And does anyone else do numbers over and over to determine what they need on the final for whatever grade they want?
I still want to do that online coding over break!!
I mean it comes down to "recognition" rather than memorizing because I had an exam Monday and Tuesday which both needed way more than memorization/recognition to prepare for
Meds and Terms.. Just like a pure memorization exam
People were so exhausted from studying they chugged monsters before haha
That exam blew!!!!! 
That moment before an exam you realize how little you actually know..
:/ Did you just take it?
Who has heard of Kalin and Myles?? If you have listen to I See You it's pretty good
Me between all these finals
https://media0.giphy.com/media/kFcqmxrh5txwQ/giphy.gif
3. I tell people to stop texting and driving but I do it myself
1. Yes
2. Quick text or read an email
3. Usually at stop lights I do it but definitely naive to the dangers haha
Might not be able to come home until the 18th though
17th
Probs start Kristinn on the left instead of Meram
I like McCoy's way of thinking today!
Who agrees with that?
We just need to play Kristenn more ☺️
But who do I want to replace is the question........ I love our outside backs, parkhurst has been better, Sauro I like, Trapp obvi and Tchani is kinda a gay sometimes but good and so on
Also that video I posted about those bad jokes he defended the MLS by saying we are 20 years old and other leagues are close to 100 and their leagues were in complete shambles back when they were this young so I think taking that into account we have to realize we are just growing! 
If we put an average of 100 more fans in seats for this upcoming season then this is all a success for me!!
THATS THE ATTITUDE!!!!
�
Higuain wasn't as good as I would've liked either.. And why has Finlay reverted back to just trying to sprint as fast as possible and losing it
Tha sucked... To lose a game which was 50/50 the whole time off the worst mistakes and missed call
The order you guys were standing in because I saw you on tv!!!!!!
McCoy - Danniele - Craig - Julie - Logan
Hahaha Nick your girl's pic on Facebook 😂
7 hours 😳
😳😳😳
And the putting an end to some annoying jokes
Hahaha I love the MLS support 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFMIMxJWTGw
That would be fun
Ohhh yeah definitely!!! 
Well soccer as well but Christmas Eve classic I don't want any randoms
That Gif 😂😂
Aight so I'm not the only one lol
Niel are you going?
ITS GONNA BE A GOOD CHRISTMAS!!
Haha That would be crazy..... We would literally have to pay for him and pay for a bigger stadium just to fit all the new fans
I am really excited to see who the crew sign next!!! Especially if we win!
OFF THE POST!
WHAT!!!
He's too fast for his own good
Hahaha I was waiting for someone to say that
Ices the cake
I still say 50/50 game since it's just a game of who can score on the counter... I'm waiting for that one Crew goal that basically seals in
I'm afraid of NYRB scoring one and getting hot hand and wreck us
I think this will be a high scoring game.. Maybe my 1-1 prediction wasn't enough
I say 1-1
Got it
How do I stream???
Breaking News: C Supreme has officially passed Niel.Skalican
So maybe end of June?
For pharmacy we all have 6 weeks of school this summer so that our program isn't a 7 year program
I can't I have school
Woah
Woah..
BARKLEY!!!!!!!!!
It's sooooo hard to dribble.. I must need to play it a lot 
Do you guys like 16 more than 15?? I just played it and it's so jerky and the dribbling is awful
My dad just died laughing at this 😂
Home screen -> go to groupme -> then it should be right there in the app
I can take him...
By that I mean where there are many many games!
I think we all should get a crazy ping pong tournament and add that to our traditions... Who agrees??
Ordered my jersey ✅
Not me
Should we do it on FIFA 15 or 16?
There we go! I was waiting haha 
Hahaha Suck it Craig! And guys how about we draft for the FIFA tournement the first time we hang out for Christmas break and then have the tournament the second time we hang out
Did McCoy get new paint on his car?
Haha If we are allowed to use it...
YESSSSSS
Dang..
We could hot tub..
Nick?
Is everyone home??
FINALLY HOME
I KNOW!!! WHAT A BOSS!!
http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=intl:2718425
Kei Kamara sports science
What's the date??
WAS THAT A MEG BY HIGUAIN!?!?!?
 Wowowowow
Jealous
And Leicester being in the #1 spot
Anyone watching Tottenham kicking some butt?
Hmm maybe me and Curt can get you on our team!
6 of us
I wish all 5 of us could play somehow
Hmm.. I might do that if I play alone
Haven't ever done training but from everything I've seen its the best thing ever
Hahaha I don't even know if we have good connection or not.. I'm currently working on incorporating flying into my games
Wait what the heck? Lol Yours has to be different than PS4 😂
Hahaha I used Curtis' second account for a while so I just started my own named after my favorite soccer ball Baden and I am level 15
I just played 1 V 1 and they like quit mid way through so I took some time to pad my stats
McCoy.... My good man... I believe our aggregate was about 9 - 2 
Get on my level boyz
Haha What?
I'm 100% serious too lol
Haha Yeah I play all the time!!
ZACH I PLAY ROCKET LEAGUE ALMOST ON THE DAILY WITH CURTIS ON HIS PS4!!
Nice!!! 
It's almost been like 8 years or something
Wait McCoy how did you explain us!?
Actually Tuesday night!
And next Wednesday!
Why?
I'm down
Ohh I get it
What do you mean?
Woah that's sweet
Surprised no one has brought up Paris 
If I can do it then anyone can do it
It's quite simple though!
As of now I agree... Like Neymar is not better "now" than both the way Ronaldo and Messi were
No matter what as long as Neymar doesn't get hurt he will skyrocket 
So I will like my own
Nick I want to like your comment again 😂
As for my Avi..... Deal with it
Ronaldinho -> Messi -> Neymar
I watch his highlights too and it no longer is pure flair it's just the complete package now
Messi is hurt, Ronaldo is in a slump and if you take all of his data and line them up looking at the big picture he has declined (makes me want to cry but still) and Neymar has completely over taken everything with the help of Suarez
I love you.
The Founder of No Shave November
No I don't think so
Lovin this day off...
I hate ESPN lol
Still would've traded you to be at that game
Either way though I had on the lucky socks!
I have an exam tomorrow 😩
IM SO JEALOUS!!!!
BEST GAME IVE EVER WATCHED
YYYYYEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH
DYDHEYEYYEYEESSSSSHSJSJFJF
Side
Off
Lucky socks.. We basically already won
GOALLLL
Curtis went to click on you and said you weren't there lol
It says you aren't in it there's only 9 people
Nick why you out of the fantasy??
I assume that's a no
http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7503068
I believe that the "revenues" from the athletics include all the ticket sales, tv earnings, and everything 
INSANELY stupid... There we go if we got a president to take action on something like that then that will solve the whole supplying money for college students issue
RIGHT!!! You could be going through college with a substantial decrease in money out of your pocket if it weren't for that
Niel that college sports video you liked on Facebook is soooo true
✅
Put a ✅ if you've already sent in your jersey specs
YAS
UNNECESSARY RABONA!!!
Yep! Haha
I know we are lucky
We also can make floating gaf heads
Any more question Craig?
Screw Drogba.. I hope he dies for 80 minutes and then they resuscitate him but has complications and dies again for 90 minutes the next time we play them
10
And I sat Lukaku
When the person you start is the only attacker without involvement in a goal
😡
2-2
I didn't even catch that!
😂
Time to play a be a pro match!
Nope.. Tipped off of Stones
Just traded him Friday 😑
GOAL
Even someone like that would make a difference
Moyes
Hahaha They would poison his legacy!
I agree McCoy that's what I thought!! Like they are still just as good mentally in their later ages and if we can snatch them up because they wanted a change of pace that would grow our league like crazy!
Alright guys here's a question for you all!! We talk about MLS getting all these great players such as Drogba who come in and make an impact but what would you guys think the outcome would be if we instead got someone like Pep or Mourinho here?
OMFG HOWARD IS A FREAKEN BOSS!!!
*Goes to YouTube, types in Birdy, listens to two songs, turns it off, decides that's not for me*
I've had twenty one pilots going on my laptop for literally 6 hours now
I know ☹
I started only 3 defenders.... People better start scoring
"Next season"... I think every day he is getting older and one injury or knock can be the end of him and all his form
I still can't admit to myself he is a sure thing for next season
Like no big name player wants to go to Australian league to retire instead Beckham chose to come here and opened the possibility that we are a good and equal league and now players see us as a growing league and want to join.. So if those three big name players are here and they suck then whatever that's their respective teams deciding to waste one of their starting 11 but keep them here and help the league grow
I agree but for now we are in transition state so to get linked to more good players as time goes on we have to have a league with some good players already.. Don't know if that makes sense
I CALLED IT!! HE SUCKED
Logan won fantasy, Galaxy already out of tourney, and I am crying on the inside
I will fill you in
I didn't even see jy
I think Gerrard is a waste of money
😂😂😂😂
Earlier the better
Yeah because I would say about at least 4 other people tried talking to him
I got his business card as well but he told me he graduated from ONU so he would be happy to have you! 
He said he will take any students for shadowing.... I would do this he seems knowledgeable and easy to talk to
It's up to you! Let me know your email if you want but I could always try to get his
For real???
"A lot of pharmacists don't want to go into oncology pharmacy so I'm hoping to change your mind" 
That sounds good for you!
But I'm not leaning towards that as of now
Haha Perks is we are different years so never have to worry about competition!
That way I could actually learn instead of him fly through it 
I think so! I wish he gave us the PowerPoint so I can take notes but whatev
😂😂 Touché
Nick I'm currently listening to an oncology pharmacist giving a presentation during my lunch
MY SHINY TEETH THE SPARKLE!! JUST LIKE THE STARS IN SPACE!!
Hahaha I wish we started it all sooner
But Nick I would save that in your notes and you can be our secretary haha
McCoy you sortve got shafted with MIT since you two were equal before it lol
Hahaha Nah he deserved it for sure..
Anything t possibly increase competition throughout any season makes me happy because people quit literally within weeks
I vote for the MLS Supporters Shield to be a thing...
My two defenders didn't play so there was no chance
I think regardless of Adi scoring I lost it
😩😩😩
If I captained Nagbe it would've been so much better
Giovinco needs a brace to get me back in this
Finley killing it.... Congratulations Logan on your first fantasy trophy lol
Gargan and Feilhaber aren't playing either!!! 😩😩😩😩
Hahaha Jeez Nick..
Remick isn't playing so hopefully Polster or Burling get subbed in or something
Hahaha If only he was good
Too bad Nagbe will be scoring the goals today
Nice Adi trade
Logan what goalie do you have playing?
Logan all trades better be in that excel sheet!
😂😂😂😂 He has a point craig
😂😂☺️
Jersey exchange, somehow start some FIFA draft picking (we can do the tourney over Christmas break), and make sure everyone has their Santa hats if they are feeling the SOCCER Classic which undisputedly will be held Christmas Eve 
Craig is current champ of the SOCCER Classic! 
Hahaha This whole time I knew Niel was just waiting to pick a fight and now it's all gone 😂
🔥
Wait... Did Niel just call out Nick in fantasy?
You're missing out.. 
And Tottenham 5-1
He's good!
Yeah they are really fighting for their life right now
I thought it was something minor a long time ago
For how long?
Another question.. Where the heck is David Silva?
Haha It's funny because it's even on the excel that we both have him
I made two transfers and made sure not to use anyone else's players
You're fine you don't have to worry about it lol
My team is 100% updated on the excel
You have one of my players Logan... Polster
Hahahaha
Liked my own post 😎
Lamela scored
3 - 1
Lol not @ Tottenham you jerk
If Kolarov scores and keeps a clean sheet then that's my only way at a decent week
I wish..
Craig you are such a lovable guy.. I want you to take my wedding pics 
We should start a larp team
No it wasn't!!! There was no harm in that message!!
Haha I actually meant to know if he was serious!! I like a competitive league unlike last year! Everyone drops off at different times
Are you being sarcastic or serious? Legit question
Not proud... Mls is all I've got right niw
Don't remind me
Keeping the fantasy titles with Nick and me
DOWN WITH THE PATIÑOS
I'm trying!
Yeah that's what the bottom part is
Andre taking last
Nick you got the Supporter's Shield
McCoy do you have any other players this week? I don't think you have any SKC or COL..
Tell me about it...
McCoy this Galaxy game rn is going to basically decide which one of us moves on
Truu
So the only person I know that has been rightfully assigned is Niel
You guys need to become true fans of the show
I'm all caught up except 1 episode
Get ready for some Vinegar strokes my friend
😏
I'll be Sophia if Logan is Ruxin
😂
I love how I'm still capitalized :)
Logan..
I thought McCoy was Taco and Logan was Kevin since Julie is a subpar version of Jenny
Therefore Niel is going to secretly steal my girl.....
Wait... Who's Pete?
I need Galaxy to wreck Portland up the anus
Yeah!! Hahaha
I could've got rid of had 8 trades by this time!
Yeah 😩
And I forgot our MLS goes into Semi finals and all that so I've given up the past 4 weeks instead of prepare my team and now I might lose to McCoy..... 😑
Hahahaha Step it up Nielson!
Who likes my Avi?
Noice!
Lazy sundays
Zach has the heart and the gumption
Hahaha I think we are all in agreement!
Currently talking with Curtis about how socialism wouldn't work and all that crap and I brought up a good point to him: Why don't we let Zach run our country?
Neymar: 4 goals + 1 assist
4:20
Sorry the first pic goes last
Alright everyone... I redid it and actually voted and read about each issue and how much I care and here it is... I am basically nobody
What did you guys say about the union thing?
Hahaha Who are these people?
Ohhhh I gotcha!
When they said tax the rich for less student loan interest what do they consider the "rich"
I have tears coming out of my face
😂😂😂😂 I'm literally dying laughing
Wow Zach you are truly awful hahahaha
😂😂😂😂 That message is so wrong I had to like it 
Curtis proposed an idea of the purge 👍🏽
😂😂😂😂😂
Because that is bias for sure I'm not that awful of a person hahaha
Yeah that's why I would never say anyone in specific lol
I would never say for a single person to not reproduce I'm saying that uneducated/intelligent group as a whole
I am black and white with it and I don't mean to be so strict but I'm saying overall concept hahaha
But I mean in all seriousness it's kinda true!!! McCoy you're a man of knowledge aren't you!?
Hahha I am just tough enough to say it!
What!?!?
But wouldn't you guys say that the trash of America not technically just "go die" but not reproduce and pass their genes on?
Guys I will do mine again later and take it serious haha
He said since I still believe in survival of the fittest I'm a conservative
Guys supposedly I'm a conservative according to Curtis
I feel like I should've said if I care more or less about things and done the extra questions instead of somewhat for everything hahaha
Y'all are tender
Hilary is going to win... 
What can I say fellas.. I'm known for my tough ess
5-7min
Analyze me!! I guess I'm a Hilary Clinton kind of gal 💁🏽
Hahaha Cincinnati Binturongs 
Soooo Toledo is better than Cinci.. Let's redo the conversation from last year at this point in time while I'm considered the number 2 college in this chat
I think I can help with the Pam pamb delimna.. The answer is Wil Trapp
If I were Klinsmann I would go H.A.M. on getting these young players to the best they can be because they are our best hope! 
Yeah!! I have high hopes for him as well as the Internet does haha
No like Alevero?
What's that young center backs name?
And Yedlin of course
Just wait for Gyasi Trapp and that young center back to start taking over
However losing big games is not okay I do agree there but friendlies are experiment times in my eyes
The man has to deal with mediocre players and new talents and somehow try to please us each and every game
Hey now! He's our national team coach respect him!
Well would you guys say Klinsman is quite a direct guy and doesn't care as much for the Spain-like possession? Because with our low quality of pace and skill we can't play quick counter attacks like that like Brazil could or teams like Real Madrid
From everything I saw online it's always because our awful play out of the back and lack of possession because of these awful plays
I saw those yesterday
Hi Niel
🙍🏽
Btw Logan my Be a Pro is now up to an 87 overall.. Workin it hard
Hi Zach
Haha Nick I like the Avi
I'm saying that our old experienced players are going downhill just in general and our new players are taking over like Zardes and soon to be Trapp and I think the transition is killing us.. Our line up seems to be quite different from the World Cup line up and we have three years to experiment and make that again
Btw I think whatever happens today happens and Klinnsman can't always be at fault for such a young team.. To bring someone new in would cause so many problems so unless he starts ruining our chances at qualifying for the World Cup my opinion is always leave him there and let our players get experience
Oh shoot I should be good then
For when it comes on just in case
:)
The game
Can anyone help out?
I'm totally blanking on streaming sites...
That's sexy...
Should I actually get this app?
Is it on cable tv?
I vote Howard but I'm fine with Guzan he does a good job
It's homecomin week so we better
Kent State
Toledo plays at 3 to keep the unbeaten streak!
Also I hate you
That's quite the tip 👀👀
Yeah it's easy probably if you have all of that knowledge but not from the ground floor lol. It's all good though that's a popular technology and it'll be good to learn!
So it's gonna take a while to start 😂
Not any more than the description I read!
Can't wait to graduate from ONU
Guys I just picked up my cap and gown!!!
I'm partial to the Scooby doobie
Boiii i bet
Sorry @Craig Casto :(  and shut up Nick haha
They actually got asked that and Jamie was just kinda like "well nobody really knows" but Adam said emphatically yes
Nah it was q&a stuff but it was still interesting to hear them speak
You're a monster Brian. And yeah it was cool!
That's terrible man I'm so sorry
Yeah what did they tell you?
Wait what...
What...
Tru
That'd be pretty fun actually
I'm watching now. 2-0 :(
Unfortunately no I'm about to go eat but if we​ get home in time I'm gonna put it on. What's the score?
Oh well I won't be home until tomorrow but maybe then?
When?
Wow I hate you. And yeah it's a holiday for you to spend with us
@Niel Skalican 
@poonslayer 
Tru
Yep it's just a sublet from July-late December/early January. I'm using a guy's room who normally lives there
Nah this is for while Julie's still doing her last semester. I'm rooming with two med students at BU
And it is pricey but I've got two roomies
Unit 4 haha. I saw the interior briefly but it looked nice. And it'd better have a stripper pole
IKR I forgot I hadn't talked to you about this!
Just signed my first ever lease 😱
570 Massachusetts Ave
570 Massachusetts Ave, Boston, MA 02118

https://goo.gl/maps/hDAi23zTTAH2
I thought RL meant real life and I was so confused
Haha I think it had something to do with getting a Nexus so you might have it too
Well for whatever reason I have 65GB. 15 might be a bit tight. I'm using 9 now
But Dropbox works too
More than I feel comfortable about. Last time I turned it on neither my trackpad nor my keyboard were working. And I do it through Google drive. You can pick folders on your hard drive to automatically sync
It's rough. I have a lot backed up but it still sucks and if it needs fixed it'll be pricey
Well the code I was working on was only on my laptop. But I borrowed a keyboard and mouse from the library and put it on GitHub so I can work on it wherever now. I just don't want my laptop to be messed up 😞
Keep me in your thoughts everyone...I spilled coffee on my laptop and have a lab due at midnight.
🔥🔥🔥
Haha yeah I'm moving like right after Myrtle Beach. That would be awesome for a round trip
This is julie. Hector recognized me from Instagram hahahsh
Oh get out of here
Uh so????????????????
You could've 🙄🙄🙄
I had no idea. That was awesome
And he recognized Julie 😂😂
Idc that was awesome. Hector Jimenez was with him
Shut up he was so chill
I just shook hands with Justin meram as I left a bar...nbd
I'm at school now but maybe tonight!
Lol yeah I agree. I can get annoyed too but you're right that nobody else really takes people one and that's what annoys me about finlay because he tries sometimes but is way less skilled at it than meram
That was the thought yeah... A little extreme for me but definitely an option in a year or two
I doubt it honestly meram has looked good
I also saw people mentioning putting meram in the center and putting Manneh in his old spot
Yeah I wouldn't be too mad about that honestly. He's looked pretty meh to start the season
@Nick Casto did you see the latest crew trade?
!!
Yeah I didn't think the CW Columbus reached out there actually
Oh boy that was sexy
It's all good famo
On the CW yeah
Woo
IT'S LIT
And he scored!
I know I'm hyped
@Niel Skalican 
The fitness model Julie watches videos of all the time
Nikki blacketter!
Yeah Erin queen was gonna go with us and bailed last minute so we just stayed here
We were going to meet bae AKA Nikki blacketter
Well we were SUPPOSED to be driving back from NYC at that point but that changed today. So I'm real af actually
!
Nothing
WHEN
HYPE AF
Me jamming to passionfruit in the car
I don't think so famo
Keep going I'm so close
Looks like some discrete math to me
I was super confused by that message earlier but yeah I started listening to the album and that's a good one
RIP JULIE
That's literally why she picked duke
Fine I want you to marry her then
We're all Bearcats on this blessed day
Nah I like watching basketball as is but the addition of immediate stakes and a group competition with the brackets makes it pretty easily watchable I think. But more so with an actual team to root for for sure
He's like me lol no college basketball all year but I love march madness because of the bracket competition
But you're safe
You must face the embarrassment
Fair enough, which is why they'll win the whole thing
I'm surprised almost everyone picked Michigan for this game
THE BRACKET LIVES
Well Michigan is up by 30 rn so nothing to worry about there
Yeah according to my bracket UCLA isn't even gonna make it out of this round
Pretty sure I did too
That ND loss hurts
b o i
This goes for everyone. We move as a caravan
Do it
I'm literally moving to MA you dumb
It really is :(
That is a tough situation... And yeah I see what you're saying Nick that if they're out of money there's not much they can do. But definitely a good idea to email about it. I think the email looks fine
It says she can because she filled out that bracket last night but we have a limit of one bracket per person
OR if you can increase the number of brackets we can have so that she can add her good one
Now she's asking if you can delete her old bracket somehow
Julie added the wrong bracket to our group. She's asking @Nick Casto if you can unlock it for her
I'm a dirty traitor I know. But I have to do what it takes to win
But I'm really sorry :(
That belly button tho
Come on Craig none of us do
Nice
It's beautiful isn't it
Seriously. That's horrible
smh I'm sorry Zach
We go to a hockey game together every year you dumb. And yeah what does that mean...
Thanks for the invite bro
Nothing honestly. You here now?
He's up there in Wal-Mart
Also nick I had a busy week sry
lmbo
Fake af
Moi!
Oh well at least you had a reason I thought you really drove all the way down for that on a weekday lol
WHAT like in Columbus??
Omg. And nick that picture won't load for some reason
Yeah they're pretty great
Yep I'm still good
Jeal
Leak was legit 🔥🔥🔥
I'm sorry Craig
You are... So dumb
That was me earlier you dumb
But I'm about to give it back to him 
Logan left his phone at my house bitches
dat Arizona weather tho
Well any preference?
Yeah location-wise it's a big difference. Are the programs similar in structure and whatnot?
Debatable
The only other application was to OSU right?
No matter your choice, having to make a decision is a good problem to have
My man
Yeah I visited Pittsburgh once. It was for only like a day but it was pretty cool
tru. When you say top 40 how high? Like what is really the difference between them?
Pittsburgh is closer to Boston �
Oh well in that case that might be better. I was just gonna say idk how they rank in the program
Also Arizona > Pittsburgh
Congrats though!
fr we're trying to see that schmoney
Meram would be cool
That jersey is still sexy. We're back to the best kit combo in the league
It's gonna be the same as last year
It's gonna be the same as last year
Tchani for sure
And sane
And yeah I hate that I want one bow
Now we need a full checkerboard kit ;)
That checkerboard pattern is so sexy
Omg that's hot. Especially when the sponsor is actually on there right. The Acura logo is cool
Lmao
This is Julie  Logan doesn't want to look. The jersey is sexy but I hate Acura 
I'm scared to look
I have it I just haven't opened it yet
Yeah I haven't played in a bit
Sorry 😂
Well actually Julie and I are gonna be celebrating our anniversary this weekend so...
That's insane I was so confused at first 😂
Yes I'm gonna watch with the kit and everything
I could think about the 25th but I won't be able to this week
Lol I turned the sensitivity up the other day and is too high apparently
Same. I saw the teaser and read that people who have seen the new kit really like ot
"boob"
You were basically a god card
If I remember correctly that card was op tho
That really killed me when he casually drew that card
This is getting out of hand 😂
Thicc Nicc
HB BBY
I don't think I can :/
Okay I'll be sure to tell you �
Oh boy. Well thanks 😂
Umm......what
Oh yeah that was a pretty great game honestly
He's being a little sensitive right now. And you mean like the one we had for ps3?
Yeah that sounds awesome. I've never been skiing
Sign me up
So jealous. And yeah I have heard that nick you should come up
Why am I moving to Boston
Also you've had more snow days in one semester than I've had in four years here
That's crazy that it's normally faster. But McCoy if you haven't heard yet we got 60 down at the house the other day
I think it should now. And getting the full standings and your position
Yeah that part's not working I guess :(
But really you don't have to use his name anymore
Blart's a savage.
How many points does @Brian Hoffman have?
How many points does @Craig Casto have?
Triggered
I believe he said he's a work in progress
You suck McCoy
BLART PLZ
Ooh
I've never met this guy in my life
🤔
What about me Blart?
Uhhh
😎😎😎
😂😂
I missed it 😭
Aww man that sounds p good though
Graeter's makes beer??
Yeah man ark is such a great game
"to have known you"
Also you would 😂
Lol it's all good. That's awesome that it seems like it was pretty chill and based a lot on your interests. Hopefully Microsoft goes similarly.
Yeah I feel like that would be something you'd really enjoy
What was it like?
I forgot those were today. Nice!!
Cambridge, 02139
@Nick Casto truly bffs
Definitely just attacked with a kill
Good times
That's awesome!
If they used a pi you might be right honestly
What language and stuff?
Well I like that I actually do well in MLS but whichever is fine lol
@Niel Skalican
@Niel Skalican
@Niel Skalican 

You can't hide forever.
Sounds fun to me!
Well sign me up whenever it happens please because that was so fun
Lol still though. Your party was the most poppin that night
Girls were flocking to you like a fresh suet cake
You already are man I saw it in person
You got it Nick I believe in you
JUST DO IT
That sounds nice and all but... That body pillow
You wanna be what?
These kinds of things are why Julie makes fun of us for watching that show 😂😂
That's at LEAST as good
Slaying some bday poon
hb
HEY @poonslayer 
@Nick Casto same...Those were THE bus ride songs
Um well I just started yesterday and I know that you can win like box things that open after a certain amount of time but...Not sure how to get them exactly
Probably just in the indoor place because of the cold
And it takes forever but this is different I'm assuming
You just hate it because we play iy
Sounds pretty bomb
😂
And I got that too 
I did actually but haven't played. It's good?
https://youtu.be/qWjNH4pTHbc

Actually me rn
@poonslayer you can get pork katsu bowls at curl now...
I saw some picture of the crew crest in Ghanaian flag colors and it was so fitting lol
Is that fence incredibly sharp?
How did it come down on the fence so hard??
Actually me rn tbh tho...
Well I guess we'll find ouy
I'm down
rekt
I heard a little bit of it on the radio this morning and it was cringe worthy lol
I'm not too picky though if it ends up being a bit more
Yeah that's fair. I'd also say $150-200
What was the cost last year?
And you're really reading that?
I jumped and audibly made some noise of fear on a few occasions and dad was laughing at me but aw man. I might actually try using my headphones and playing the next piece sometime alone just to see how long I can last
Yep that one. And I won't say anything because you can still do the chapter select to pick up from where we left off. But yeah I did one more sixth and oh man I'm glad I didn't do it like tonight at midnight or something
Scarier
So McCoy wasn't lying...That game we got really gets scariee
fr though that's awesome. I'd be so jeal if you got to go to Seattle
mfw Microsoft never even answered me
Sounds like me
Yeah I remember that 😂
Two sigma was the one you took at home right?
Maybe but the good thing is that you get all that time to really think about the problems which I liked a lot
Oh I think just two, maybe 3. But one was being evaluated on runtime and to pass completely I had to learn a new concept for it lol but that was pretty cool. I actually watched some open courseware videos to figure it out
Also a week, that's why I asked
Haha nice. Well let me know what the questions are on it. I wonder how similar they are to the ones I had
@poonslayer yeet do you have a whole week to do it?
The home ones?? Yeah that's some dumb scheduling
I saw! There's like one good away game per month
Pretty long but doable. And yeah I was thinking of the cool new stadium
New York or Atlanta would be my picks of the driving distance ones
I'd say come up to watch them play the revs but that's not the nicest stadium experience to visit lol
Same. Regardless though I think going to an away game would be awesome to do again
That's definitely be preferable but obviously that won't be doable for everyone
Yeah I don't think I'd really wanna drive...
Same I've wanted to visit the Pacific Northwest for a while. And either place would be awesome for a soccer game
I would absolutely love that 
Also Brian...One time?
I'm a sucker for lion metaphors
Hey now that's extreme
But I mean I don't think it's wrong of you to be a bit concerned
You can cry on my shoulder man... is okay
Her
I see what McCoy's saying and if it were me I might just trust it but at the same time you have a right to be uncomfortable and to express that to hee
Exactly. If it's really that little just give her that money or something lol. I'd take that over the alternative
Like Niel said it could def cause a conflict
@Brian Hoffman are you 100% sure that she would only be paying like $25 more? Because in that case you could argue it but otherwise idk..
Fun ((:)
Fun :)))
Because hiding things only makes it seem suspicious
Yeah like maybe she just didn't want to say anything because she didn't want to worry you and is truly just concerned about the money but... You need to tell her that when it comes to something like that that she should be open with you
That's p sketch...
Yeah I like the white
Ours is the next week
That's a long spring break
Plz see my snap to you
Also I finally know who your avi is!!
It was a wonderful experience and I'm at least 50% gayer for it
@poonslayer...I finished
🤔🤔🤔
Yeah what..
Yeah I would. And then pay off stuff for my family, find a nice place to live, and chill and save money for a life with no work and travel
I gotchu
We're good whenever today btw
Incline??
I'd prefer tomorrow tbh. Sorry Craig :(
Doesn't matter to me
I thought you couldn't tonight?
I'm v down
As in tomorrow?
I'm down whenever! I'll be busy Friday evening but any night is good with me
Nice
Wow he said he was hanging with your grandparents
Niel's here and Julie's on her way
At least you're a champ
Shut up
That's cool Zach and nah Niel 16 should be fine
Yes Niel and no unless someone else has 17
Yep it'll be lit
Well McCoy already showed up so you're good
Me neither it's gonna be a skilled battle
Or at least it can be and YES to lil c's
It's tonight
Yep everyone feel free to come over whenever!
All good fam
Early but idk when. I was thinking everyone could stay tonight so we can all get up and go
Well I think Niel and I are gonna go downtown tonight and you're free to come with us @Nick Casto.
Probably around 2 or so
?
Haha I know I'm jk. I can go pick you up later. I'll let you know when I can head out. You're good whenever!
Well sorry see ya next year I guess
Anyone wanna hang with McCoy, Niel, and I today?
Yep sounds like we're good to go!
👍
Not tonight but any other day
Are you in cbus now?
Yessir
Nothing on Thursday for me
Idk about EVERYTHING
YES
But that being said I'm 101% sure
This isn't a competition craig
😂
I was gonna say you weren't even there 
Lol I'm sure we talked. Either way I had an awesome time
We hung out the whole night??
I haven't taken one step in the house without them on
I asked for the exact same kind for Christmas 😂
It doesn't have to be everyone together just whoever wants to hang
I want to. I'm not doing anything so I'm free whenever
@Niel Skalican since you've got us muted
thx bby
I've been exfoliating
So right now we're 5/7
Okay cool
McCoy and I have ours
:(  It's all good I just wanna make sure we can get together for that and then we can deal with jerseys another time if we need to. What about everyone else?
So is new year's Eve morning still good for everyone for the SOCCER classic?
Yeah we haven't opened yet either
Yeah man come on over
smh I could've told her that
January 9
Mine are usually an hour 45
ONE MORE SEMESTER 🎉🎉🎉
Hey same time as me!
They're scared of the truth
Craig that is just false and HA
Well Julie agrees with me so that's one for the good fight
Yeah... The specific GARLIC kind
YOU TOO REALLY
*Ridiculous
You guys are difficult
And it's also that plain, thick bread you buy for French toast
The wiki page says they were originally just large pieces grilled and buttered...still no garlic
How would you even know that
Toast is just toast!!! Sure you can put garlic and butter on it but the TOAST is just bread
Think canes
Texas toast is not always garlic bread
A selfie?
Nick I saw Donnie's snap story so I know what you're talking about now and...you're wrong
2 HYPED
@poonslayer I'M OFFICIALLY IN CAMBRIDGE
0 down 3 to go
Going for that sneaky good pick
It was sorta lame and no you don't
J cole with the winner
I figured you would
Dat save tho
WHAT A HIT
Moi
You just let me know
You just said it was gonna be a banger!
If you don't want me to come up then fine
I've never been though!
Looks like I'm coming up to Ada
What I was so looking forward to it 😭
This Thursday night tho 😎
😂
What would that even mean 
Yep I wanna live downtown no matter what. Julie agrees that back bay looks nice 😉
Hoping for Cambridge tho 🙏🙏
Yeah there's that and another that are about the same distance outside of Boston. So it could be any of the three
😃😃😃  Unfortunately it's not 100% I end up at that specific office :(
rly
Also jfc
It takes time to grow into a seasoned comedian like your big bro
Btw I'm all about mercilessly sucking
What a weeb amirite
Yep that's it I just looked it up
Well I don't mean the main one but some version like 2 or 3
Weren't some on ESPN this year?
My jersey has arrived! Am I the first?
Yeahhh she did say that so good call
No idea. One of my mom's students. She just said that it seemed insane how many medications he had to take so she wanted me to see what you guys said
What about all of it at the same time?
So @pharmacypeople is this safe
Nick... No one is impressed
Wow I haven't even had one yet. But I did just finish my last class!
Well I can go!
Okay cool
Hey so Myrtle Beach would be what days again?
@Niel Skalican 
@Craig Casto 
smh yes
Okay new year's Eve thrn
Let's do new year's morning. Kick off the year with some friendly competition
Yes
Yeah I could do it after Christmas since that might work best
Were there symptoms that made them check or something?
Not good. I'm sorry
I'm here now
IT BEGINS
Why'd you have to ruin it Brian
I know I do
Imma check that out ASAP
Well let me know if you hear anything. I've just been trying to see from Twitter and yik yak
Way too scary man
The only new thing I know is that they locked down campus so nobody can get in. From pictures it looks there there are a million cop cars and ambulances
Yeah it's serious. At least 7 people in the hospital
There's at least one shooter on campus
I just see a bunch of cop cars and ambulances outside the window. I'm in the library like a block away from where everything's happening
I just see a bunch of cop cars and ambulances outside the window. I'm in the library like a block away from where everything's happening
I won't. But man this is scary.
I'm about to leave campus now
Lol Julie's roommates said the exact same thing
Nah I got to use it luckily lol. But yeah they escorted me out after I was trying to leave
There were some people in the bathroom waiting because apparently quite a few guys hop over because of the lines :(
Not fun. But at least they won
I watched until halftime at a tailgate and then Julie came out and we went back to her place. But yeah I was so mad I looked forward to this game all year
I still had like 20 people in front of me though. And there are other bathrooms but I'd already been in that like for the whole second quarter and felt like that was the closest I was gonna get
I guess I should've. I really didn't know what to do lol I've never had to pee so bad in my life
Yes lol and no clue I guess he just slipped by
Yep 😑😑😑
Yep. End of the first quarter I went to pee and waited 30 minutes in like and still had like 10 minutes to go. It hurt so bad I thought I was gonna pass out. This guy behind me went into the women's bathroom and came back out and said it would be cool and I was so desperate i did it and there was security in the bathroom and they kicked me out and my ticket wouldn't scan back in
Yes because I barely got to see the game 😑
Craig: "We should just drive out right now to Chicago, knock on @poonslayer's door...wait."
Not sure but I already told them you guys would be here at 7
There are people still here but you should be fine
Nice job @Nick Casto 
That's cool with me!
Yeah I think that'll work. We just got done eating
Aww man. Well it's up to you but I'd be happy if you came
Would you go to campus with me tomorrow?
I already said me!
I will. I'm not sleeping
Plus nick I wanted you to come to campus with me tomorrow
Tell him to Uber up there
Somewhere around there. I'll give you guys a heads up
👍
Well just so you know we're not doing anything NOW because my family is doing Thanksgiving today
Why not??
I'm down! And yeah I'm gonna be getting to campus early for sure for gameday and everything
I didn't look much but the one I wanted I couldn't find :(
So proud ❤
Idk what's happening but I love it
Because of a loss to Mexico and then an embarrassing loss to Costa Rica both in world cup qualifying
This is an /r/MLS dream come true
Wow RIP Jurgen
Oh I didn't even know he had a gf. Imma look her up on fb
Nathan has 0 game
Ohh...I thought you meant to my house
Then why did you ask if it needed provided??
1234 McCoy's Fake AF Ave.
I hate you but yis
I think I just have my priorities straight
@Craig Casto 
Nathan's my guy
It was good @Brian Hoffman. The team wasn't too bad and we didn't get as much done as we wanted but it was a good timr
Me neither Niel. And plz
I'm v down. Also sorry for not texting you back yesterday B ri
Especially on top of Friday...
Yeah I saw that too earlier. Nate said it would be sooner rather than later
I didn't watch the game so I can't make a full judgement but... Pretty bad result
I love that meme 😂
If it makes you feel better, my break starts the 23rd
He's not :(
We've been friends!
What do we need to say again? Just jerseys we have and what we don't want?
Yeah we prob should. My fav time of the year!
You getting a new one?
On
In
I just got off work but I'm bout to turn it in
Yeah I'm not a big fan of Matlab either 😂😂  And yeah brian I was gonna tell you when we ate lunch but you had to go and cancel!
MathWorks!
I've got an interview tomorrow in Natick!
😉
@poonslayer 
I do wanna go but...that's a lot
Shut up I have the supporters shield for this year. The true trophy
wtf why would it not do the playoffs IN THE PLAYOFFS
Wait that's the end?
my guy
LMAO
Fake af
I don't have a snap bruh
You're forgiven I just bonged a whole case
Even better!
Nothing wrong with some tequila shots. I think she sounds like a peach
Interesting...so what we're getting at here is that she might not be bad at all. Which is it then??
Sorry not negative but almost 0
Depending on the values of k, x, and t...she might be negative bad soo...I don't see  the problem
Brian rn
nbd
Apparently. I didn't know where he was before but he's on the OSU soccer team now
Oh haha well there ya go. That's funny actually because I just found out the other day that Matt appel is in one of my classes
I know that's Joey on the right but... Not sure about the other guy
That's awesome that you actually got to use those
I did actually and videos of it are awesome lol
Young Nug
Also brian that's the dumbest quiz I've ever seen...and I'm 27 apparently
Honestly though regarding the format...I think I'm gonna have to agree with Niel. It's really different sounding but I would definitely find it exciting I think. I'd have to see it in practice though
I'm just saying they shouldn't have hosted before, so they shouldn't in this case
Things like the world cup and Olympics have only ever been worth it for like a handful of countries so that's kind of on them to be honest and not bid
You could argue that those countries shouldn't be doing it with the current format either.
Yes 😂😂
What do you mean?
Of course!
Lmao I wish I'd make all kinds of money from that
🤘🤘🤘
Shoulda been lil dicky
❤💜💙
Submitted 😎
Also did you say the cheapest seats?
Okay. Are you and Craig just applying for one ticket?
Nice thanks. I'm gonna do it now
Don't get my hopes up like this
I know lol. But whatever might as well finish the season strong to get some momentum for next year
Crew MLS cup champs confirmed
Two wins in a row...
👍
So if anything you could stream it on fox sports' website
Actually sorry it's on FS1 today
Looks like BCSN2 if you have it
Miss u 2 bae
Yeah that's about my max too but it would be a pretty awesome experience!
I probably will. How much do you think tickets will be?
Nope
Nah fam. Are you here or something?
Yeah that's crazy to think about
Wowwwww
Man I was really rooting for the upset too
Please do I'm dying of laughter
That's cool and all but...keisuke Honda
Not sure but I can ask him later
I don't remember the exact date but someone during the last week of September
That man had a family
Exciting! And sorry Zach :(
The hype is REAL
Yeah my mom told me!
👀👀
I hate you so much 😂
Greatest moment of my summer tbh
Oh yeah well look what I saw on the bus this morning
Wow
Pumped
That looks ridiculous
@poonslayer look at dad's
😏
Pixie kitten  😺
The sequel
Okay so is he using that ticket then?
Wait so you are going to the game?
I still haven't gotten an answer lol she went to sleep early and hasn't gotten up yet. And when?
Well she hasn't answered but I'll let you know
Umm let me ask Julie first. Thank you!!
I'd be v down for that
😂😂  It does look pretty nice
glhf
*affect

And most likely keep the kid but you'd have to ask me if that ever actually happened
Yeah I was gonna say for that I'd probably keep the kid
Yeah just saying McCoy hasn't finished yet
Tag your spoilers guys
Proud of you nick
😂😂
That's pretty awesome. And yeah I do too
loganpatino10@gmail.com
If we need to then it's okay with me
I finally watched this and it was so cringeworthy
same
Want to join?
Harvest Moon cafe
Yaaaas. I'm good to chill whenever but I think McCoy, Julie, and I are going to get breakfast first
Lol
Let's just do top 4 make it look
We can just do 5 teams. And yeah what do you mean?
Yeah I saw it the other day and that's pretty wild. I would've been pretty happy if we signed him
That is true I guess
I wish :((
Sorry working
I asked Julie and autumn is in Colorado and Barry is gone
Also we can just have my parents as a last resort. Or tell uncle d to make an appearance haha
Tell her to bring a partner and she's in
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Yep @Nick Casto it's a Chromecast
Whenever is fine with me!
I'm down
Alright well come whenever
Soccer golf at 8 I just got here
Yeah dva got buffed in the last patch and is supposed to be pretty good now actually. And roadhog is pretty cool even though I suck with him. Alright anyway I'm about to leave so I'll see you guys soon!
SO NOT LEGENDARY BUT STILL LIT. JEALOUS
YOO WHAT IS THAT LEGENDARY??
And yet here I am
Also I just went to change my fantasy team and didn't realize the week already started on Wednesday 😑😑
That was a great album. I miss old Bobby 😔
That's a Kanye line noob
Yeah I might be back too late I'm leaving around 6:30 probably
???
Where's this coming from??
Yeah like 8-9 would be good for me
Honestly I'd be okay with that as a last resort
😔
That's cool, that place was really nice
Oh no I was just wondering. That's the place we went for the crew thing isn't it?
That's where we're going?
Oh yeah I didn't even notice! 13th!!
GO POLAR BEARS. And yeah I'd like to go early if possible because I told Julie I'd help her move in to her place sometime that day
That would match up with the amount of games we played last year AND people would get more guaranteed games because of the group stages. Plus the last thing is with 12 the skill level would be higher probably because we don't have to worry about just filling the numbers. The skill is good now and we could definitely get one other good team
Alright guys I have a thought on the volleyball tournament that I want your opinion on. 

The tournament is really soon and we have 10/16 people. We might not be able to get 6 more, but I think this could be a good thing. If we get just one more team, that gives us the option of doing either a 2-table round robin with the top 4 advancing or a single round robin with the same top 4. We could also do a double round robin with either of those and
Still tho you're about to be the first with a charmeleon
Disgusting
😪😪
smh
Bruh
You know it fam
$32 each and I have them as mobile tickets so I can just get us in unless you want me to send them to you to print or something
Yeah the water was pretty choppy so you could get some air today too lol my knees and back are so sore
It was super fun those things go really fast
Just at lake erie
I did tho 😉

💛💙💜💚❤
I'll take down a bear for us
Yeah I was hoping they were pins or something but I just put it on my key rink and it works pretty well
I can go out later and try to grab more. I didn't want to take too many yet in case other people wanted them but I'll go in an hour and grab you one. Anyone else?
I went to the pokestop at work and there was a bag of 3D printed emblems for each team for people to take
Jeal
???
Possibly, yeah. I thought you could claim them all from the app but I could be wrong. I'll try the gmail account next time
You're good. Which one should I use from now on?
same with the campsite money
nicholas_casto@yahoo
Alright Nick I sent you mine and Julie's money. Also you have yet to claim money I sent you for shades the other day
McCoy you da real MVP
The tickets are $32 each and that's to me
Yeah it's $11 a person. I'll send you the cash soon\
So nick what's the final price per person for the campsite?
No prob. What class is the paper for and what's it studying?
You need to ask her how many times she's gotten the answer "to be the best, like no one ever was" to the question "what is your goal in pokemon go?"
I filled it out! And okay good
So @Craig Casto do I try and return this ticket or nah?
I'm fine either way. We might just have to play it by ear and see how we feel Monday morning
Oh wow that's awesome. Works for me then!
That price is good thougu
Well that's up to you I'm cool either way
So Craig can you go or do I need to try and return this ticket?
Me!
That's cool with meN
Yep
American dollars. Also Craig 😑
Yep they have been purchased
Alright guys I'm getting the tickets now. With the service fee it's $32 a ticket
We're gonna go ahead and stay and come back on monday
I can go ahead and order them in a few minutes. I'll let you guys know what you owe me
Lol Nick just texted me that he was gonna order them tonight
Here we go again
OLA. OLA OLA. OLA OLA.
T TCHAN!!
Think of it like golf
It's all good we've been playing a lot lol
18
what is that avatar
So many water pokemon 😳
YES CRAIG
I think they've been down a bunch today
Brian no but I'm gonna get it asap and I will of course be picking bulby as well
So in the front of my building there's a rock that they paint a lot and it's a pokecenter. And I went out with some people to get some items and there were like 5 others guys there doing the same thing 😂
It looks like you can't battle other people at all
Wow...I really need to get this
Yeah it's just a time hassle and I'll miss some new features but if it's really worth it I'm down
BRUH
Lol all the pressure's on him he talked about it so much. Nick let me know if it's worth it
Yeah I found that out very sadly. I'm debating on whether or not to downgrade to try it out because it said it won't be supported until the official release which is like a month or two away
Guys Pokemon go is out now
Wow missing out again
The earliest I could get back would be like 7:30 and that's a bit late. It's all good we can hang out that night and the next day
Eh probably not actually
What time this Friday? I might be able to make it
I'm down for the 21st
Well... Thursday or Saturday maybe?
I really wanna get this figured out because we've gotta go
😑
Yo @Nick Casto @Craig Casto @Brian Hoffman check if anytime between July 16 and 23 cedar point would work. I can take any weekday off and McCoy should be free whenever so it's up to you guys
😐
GOLAAAAA
He's diving in 
Listerine is good thinking
Ah... Well you know what good for him
How do you buy listening?
Well we've got next weekend at least
So we're really not gonna hang this weekend? 😭
@Nick Casto @Craig Casto wyd tonight
Maybe he's just really excited all the time
I don't blame you that's terrifying lol
😳😳
Oh yeah... Great choice by me 😂
2 months would be so annoying lol. Which laptop do you have again?
I do not, sorry :(  That's a pretty unfortunate issue lol
#blessed
Ah...man I wish I could I'm gonna miss him too 😢
What?
Def
Hey now Myrtle Beach was a fun time. And we've got the next two weekends!
Somehow I'm not surprised
A champion knows all the rules of his competition
Nick how are you gonna say that when I actually WON last year. This is all skill. My record is no fluke.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
bruh
How is it?
I'LL BE HOME THIS WEEKEND!!!
I probably will!
Same tbh
?
I just got some practice for this year's William A Trapp award 😎
Woooooooow idk if anyone's watching this euros game but shaquiri just scored an amazing bike
I hate that I found that so funny
That's my boi
That's pretty funny Niel and Zach that was 10/10
?
So one of them just tries to meg everyone
Who are you
This field sucks wow. And yeah same but Argentina and Chile are both in good form
Basically... This tournament is super lame
Agreed.
All my copa America dreams crumbling one by one
Nope I wish :(  They're showing it at work though and a bunch of people are here watching
Wtf
This is the greatest and worst thing I've ever heard at the same time
It is so accurate 😂
We're watching the end of the game again at the Monday morning meeting 😂
*last year
This time today we were on our way down to Myrtle!
That was so wild
Like whenever you get started? Yeah I won't be crazy high level or anything lol
Nice. It's exactly the same as before
McCoy did you do the old school one?
You might be right. I just remember playing for like a week with those names
Wasn't I Amish son?
Wait isn't that guy good??
BOOL12
Seriously?? Wow. And this is just for the old school version
Yep not too shabby!
And tutorial island takes 20 years
Yeah the nostalgia is real
Ohh yeah. Level 3 cooking already 😎
It was packed. So happy for them this is a great tournament for us!
PKs 😭😭😭
Take a road trip and see brian and then me
So dumb 😂  Who celebrates a 7th anniversary anyway
AND IT'S COLOMBIA COME ON
James almost with the weak foot
When you get that first paycheck and just wanna make gainz
We don't but that's why we've gotta make one!! And it's a fantasy mmorpg so you'd like it. And we play together. I used to play it 24/7 back in middle school lol
My bff
Lame
Although we'll see some roommates might be gone
Nice that's probably for the best haha
Well I have a full and a couch...not a whole lot but we've gotta figure this out because it's gonna be crazy
Yessss it was so fun I lost my voice and didn't even realize it
Please man it's wild right now
Not my fault
Booo
What s beautiful night
Also jswi 😂😂
👀👀👀
It's wild here
I'll take a 16 point lead into halftime
Yeah come on now
Yeah this is a great start
I'm jeal. I won't be able to see it probably
Goals
What is this
Gotcha 😂
I'm going to a bar downtown. And yeah Nick don't complain. Also Zach really?
It's pretty good. I'm just now getting started actually working on stuff. A little overwhelming right now to get used to but it's a cool place
I know I'm as shocked as you 😊  And hey I've watched the finals
I'll send pics. It's about to be lit
Ya mane time to watch some cavs action downtown
Back when it wasn't about fancy graphics 
Exactly it's the nostalgia
That's fine if you do I def will. Not tonight tho
Sign me up 😂
I made fun of her more for falling asleep during the world cup final than anyone so you're good 😂
Lol I'll watch it at lunch. I just saw the title and chuckled 😂
Yeah atmosphere and saying I went would be cool. And I'll watch that later
It still could be fun to see buy I wouldn't jump at the chance basically 
Yeah I've heard it on videos before haha. From seeing big Sean I know that live rapping is more yelling than on recordings and I know Drake doesn't sing quite that well lol
I just know Drake won't sound the same live lol
Oh that's not too bad. But yeah even though I like Kanye I don't think I'd necessarily go to a concert. Kinda like with drake
I bet tickets are expensive 😕  when though?
Just chilling at home for a bit before driving back to Cleveland tbh haha nothing crazy
Thanks!! ❤❤
Zach I am so sorry 😭  have they said why?? And Brian someone in the family has FS1 on their cable 😎
Yeah I'm hoping at this point Colombia just wins out to help out
Gol de Colombia 
Yes and you are dumb
The dagger 
Yep I'd say so! Already it's been good for me to be up here forced to meet new people and see new things
Pretty good! No actual work just a lot of onboarding stuff but all the people were really nice and my team seems cool. I won't actually be doing real work for a bit because all the development interns have class to get us up to speed with the main coding language for the rest of the week and then vacation lol
Well there's a bright side at least. That was a nice header
To be fair I don't think Casey did anything
Sigh
A little but I'm excited to get a routine going. Even though I'm leaving in 3 days 😂
Starts tomorrow at 9! 
Yep!
Alright. Meet there at 7 👍
Yes bring extra. Meet there?
Well if you would like Nick and I to join that's the only option 
Let's do it
7 am works for me
That's what a champion does 
Same but it'll definitely be exciting
I know I keep checking because I want it to take as long as possible lol
Also lol
Well it might've just been the heat of the moment or something... because I didn't even hear anything about it. 
What for?
This table is about to get very condensed
OOOOOLLLLAAA
Bald
Band
Niel's name in that picture I sent is Mister Meat 😂😂😂
I'm looking to get this sex beef wet
Yeah but i somehow forgot to change my team so I'm not too confident. And my captain pick is already really bad
I'm in a slump right now 😭
SEX BEEF
Lame
I read that he wasn't 100% but yeah he hasn't done much
I love how the ref just shook his head at him
Shakira 
I will be!
Pretty tempting tbh
Nah I wish
Sure bring her along
What is that gif from
And you can tell him I said that
Weaksauce
David? dang 
Me, you, McCoy, and David. I have to text him and see if he can though 
Wanna play some v ball?
Aww man that sucks 
Yo @Nick Casto when do you get off work and @Craig Casto are you working at all?
Ya do it
The passports have been ordered!
I just saw a preview for a doctor strange movie and it stars Benedict cumberbatch!
We tried but we got there like 5 minutes too late lol. We'll be able to do it tomorrow 
VIEWS
Yeah Craig said it was looking worse 😓
Cool with me
If you wanna help sure!
Cool with me boi
I'm down
Yeah...
Johnson as a defender has me worried but I like the lineup
https://youtu.be/VkF3ur72ZgI

This needs to happen at a crew game
Alright
Well you'll be the only one so it really doesn't matter. And idk since it started raining again
Yeah lol like I said you don't have to
It's all up to you. And that's awesome I'm pumped to ride it
@Craig Casto if you really wanna help out with the sand it's all here
How was it?
...what
I never knew that one tbh
HB BRIAN 
Well I'm sure the crew still want some home field advantage 
And yeah
I worry that they're not taking it seriously though
Lame but hey at least it's still close
That's valid I think
Well it was Guatemala. And it's not quite a soccer city yet but maybe some day
What is your problem 
Come on now
I see what you mean Nick but I think they'll be able to drum up some support because of the whole Ohio thing. And there will be traveling fans
I think people will be excited since Cincy has made a big splash and it's an Ohio team
Yeah I just saw that too. I'm glad it's here but I would've made the trip
Please do because I'll for sure go to the game
There'll be plenty of fans at crew stadium. Assuming they make it past Tampa bay
Crew were drawn to play the winner of FC Cincy and Tampa Bay at home 😁
MLS > USL
You beat an NPSL team by 1
Honestly we're rooting for you so we can smash you
I just saw that!
LET'S DO IT
Whenever you get off work. We're gonna start volleyball around 2:30
Craig you're invited to this get together btw
It's actually his friend's so he's only been borrowing it
Well I don't want you to spend the money on it because we won't have it after today
Down for that as well!
I'm down
Tomorrow 
Volleyball + sleepover tomi
Invitation to everyone: volleyball/spikeball tomorrow at Brian's
ggjk
Yo b-ri we finally have your jersey 😉
Still rocking the socks
Lexi?
Nice!
I most likely will too!
Yeah I saw that. That's dumb
😭
@Zach Spangler 
Let's do it
Alright when you send it to me I'll head out
Yep it's cool with me. I'm just gonna change real quick and I'll try to leave by 7
Yep we just got back. You still want me to come get you?
Well I'm heading to the gym now so...I'll let you know
#BENDTNER2CBUS
Really? What time?
I'm v down
What he really wants is a challenge... Aka Columbus!!
Dumb
I will in case I don't feel like buying anything. And onu for sure
Same that's exciting! I might have to get a shirt there because like the only orange thing I have is a drogba ivory coast Jersey and that would feel pretty fake
That's the plan!
Wow I saw stuff last night about trading to Vancouver. Didn't expect it to be an Eastern team
I think McCoy might wanna go too
That's for nick, you, and I?
Yeah I'm down to come
👎
@Craig Casto you coming tonight?
Hey Nick can you meet us here at 5?
😳😳
Uhhhh idk what did you have in mind?
Yeah!
You still could've told us 😭
Why do you not tell us this?? 😑😑
YAS I thought you were coming back Wednesday??
😁😁 Brian you're back tomorrow right?
We should play it this week! And good brian!
Yep!
What do you mean?
Yeah I don't know why I thought it'd be that easy haha. Brian would you be down??
I know. But hey they play again July 31 at Toronto again. We could do that!
I really do too. My dad just said it takes a while to get your passport renewed...
Who else would be down??
Their stadium renovations look awesome and it could be a first away game experience!
I might have to get it renewed. But I could do that in time I'm sure!
Guys let's go to the away game at Toronto on the 21st
�
Wtf...
4 goals, a 3 goal lead, and we still manage to tie
What do you mean for whatever reason?? 😡  I'm glad he liked me he and Nick were cool and I was hoping I made a good impression lol. And he's officially a crew fan now
If so I'm out of the running
There will be 5 of us right?
I missed it but wow Bayern's out
Valid point
Seems fitting that someone is their biggest fan 



@Brian Hoffman 
Also Nick what'd Tottenham do?
http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/the-unrelenting-charlie-davies-documentary-espn

Really good short documentary on Charlie Davies if anyone's interested.
Westlake!
Yeah I will too
How's tomorrow?
Oh I saw it...same
Good times
She's laughing and I don't understand
Aston Villa's season in a screenshot
That sounds miserable
That's Korea Nick
Ni hao
Sounds good 👍
What works for you?
And Nick whenever is fine with me other than tomorrow early afternoon
And mine is 6147178779
Yep I downloaded this morning. I've listened to 1-11 so far
I thought it was the real thing
Yep hyland at 48 haha nice
Is the one you don't know hyland?
Well you know how a crew jersey looks
You got a jersey?
FINALLY
I was say I don't work during may so I could do during the week but if you can't that's cool
I could do any time in May
Zach that's crazy congrats
Well I should be good to go
14th? I will I'm not doing anything
Every time I listen to I don't care I think of it

On the way to the bowling Green tournament!!

What's it at now?
3.5 or greater
>= 3.5
Also I have not been there
Oh yeah that's not gonna happen for me haha. How about all Dean's list?
2 points 😂  You're so annoying
Nah you're selling yourself short. But you even like math/science so it doesn't matter anyway!
I barely do math. Come do CS
Oh wow lol. I barely ever have to write papers for my classes and they're never that long
Nah my finals shouldn't be that bad I don't think
With the 2nd most total points
Craig...the new cellar dweller
Yep dey here
Alright cool yeah I completely forgot
Oh yeah I still have it...
Yep! I'll be there at 5!
Oh I can just meet you at melt if that's cool
!
Yep I can do that;
HE CANNOT BE STOPPED
no way that was beautiful. I don't think I ever even tried to make a rapchat
10/10 would listen again
That was so much better than I expected
I just sent it to julie
dying rn
GO INTO THE SUPERMARKET...CLEARANCE RACK...THERE YOU IS THE COLD TURKEY
Top bantz
What?
Also you click to go faster which is useful and they didn't put controls anywhere
It's a lot different because everyone can kill everyone else. 
Slither.io
They have a sequel ish to agar.io
Fo sho that'd be lit
That's awesome I hope he loves it! Alright wish me luck everyone it's time for my first final 😶
Gladly 😁😁  I get to finally meet Donnie!
Nice I'm v down to meet you there if you're cool with it
I went once and got the chicken and waffles and it was bomb
You mean melt as in the grilled cheese place?
Julie said to send that to her lol
My baby I'm so proud 😍😍
I just got what that meant omg 😂
Okay yeah let's do that
I'll probably be good unless you wanna get something
Money has been sent ✅
Oh nice yeah that sounds perfect. And how much is Myrtle Beach again? I can send you that and the ticket money now
$20 right?
Yeah mane
Been blazing since midnight 🔥🔥🔥
It is truly amazing
I'm looking now and it says you tied
"Blood curl"
GO CRAIG
If you want sure. It does look really fun I've seen some people play it at school
My mom was talking about that the other day!! She even said we should get it for the beah
Oh I know 😍  We're watching that game now!
No I just saw what happened though!
😪 Against?
That's really cool that you can walk by and see that
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
What's a defense
YEEEEAAAAJHHH FINLAY
3-1 CREW
Fight me rn
Nah I'm keeping my crown
😭😭😭
Yeah just go ahead and give it to her
Omg this whole time I thought it was for tonight's game 😂😂😂
Wait what?
Will I be able to get it from her to get in?
Why don't you go to crew games? You could see me then
?
Picking it up whereM
Also Nick...can I buy that ticket from you or nah
Zach it's looking like at least 15000 for the FC cinci game. You've gotta go that's pretty awesome
You should!
Sorry 😭
Ohh I'm chilling with Julie for most of the night 😕  I will buy that ticket though! 
About the tickets?
It's all good. My feet are all blistered so I don't mind a break haha
If you really want then yeah I can play fo sho
Really? I'd be down
Soccer at the fields tonight if anyone wants to join
fr that song was 🔥🔥
Another classic
They were still underdogs though
Yeah it's not that they're not good but most people would choose city over Atletico in a game
I meant Atletico
That may be true but most people would agree that they're better than befica
They are not
It'd be awesome if they played the crew in the open cup
Yeah I'll let you know
My guy
powerpuffyourself.com 

And that's real tempting
Creg 😂😂
It's a good time with your bros
Thank you Niel
"Nobody knows how to play golf"

"Nobody is capable of running a marathon"
Nick you just think you're better than everyone else
I'm assuming not
I can hit a ball anywhere I want
I'm always down for a nerdy board gamr
I'm always ready
SAYS YOU
More like 1 move 
Oh yeah we'll just have a 15 minute party!
Nick I would but we're gonna be leaving at like 4:30 in the morning tomorrow for McCoy's MIT weekend thing
Later bby 😉
Coming along swimmingly if I do say so myself
😉
Thicc
I love the second man city one
Craig's new bæ
($10)
Could I get 0.005% ownership please?
I wish lol you could literally do more than him in a minute. 
I know that feel... For my class where we have to make an Android app we've got like a month left and one guy hasn't written a single line of code
You could just send it to him with Google wallet
Well I'm good just give me your email
Oh boy lol. What's your email I can send it now
Wait why so much??
And fine with me
🙋
I'll be done and ready by then so we good
Yeah I do wanna go eat somewhere. As for picking me up...can you come around the bend of the RPAC again?
Yeah I saw that crew season ticket holders got dibs and was hoping you didn't have a small limit lol because I plan on going to that too
So excited 😁
12:30. I'll just go to the gym right after that and be done with my day
I'm gonna have to hold you back omg
That would be so disappointing...
manning_face.mp3
*.jpg
^fake af
I picked Diaz though 😉
That was a good pick. That's who Craig has too
They are playing Colorado... Who'd you pick Brian?
Also, shots fired to @Craig Casto and @Niel Skalican 
To be fair, that strategy won me the league last year
You're 2-1 get outta here
Always a solid pick
Craig did you submit that
It definitely wouldn't be ideal...the sad part is I really don't have a lot of faith in them right now
@poonslayer 
I haven't either but I've heard of him
Wow
So ugly
I'm gonna start watching again soon
Thanks fam
👍👍👍
But really Nick that's fine with me it's only fair I give you something. Like you said it was expensive lol
$5000?
Nice it sounds like a fun time. Honestly I'm done with stuff at like 2 so it doesn't matter to me
Yeah that would work for me! What time would you wanna pick me up?
Then I will take it. Would we able and to ride together? I'll pay you $50 and split parking
😂😂  Zach if you do wanna go you can have it
Lol well how much was it? I don't wanna take it free
👀👀 why do you have an extra?
It's free?
Well I'm not watching but when I saw your message I was pretty much completely neutral so idk if that says anything. But if I had to pick I'd prefer the us win
I don't know how to feel about this. Also Brian i haven't listened yet but I plan on it
It is a pretty good roster but yeah they're both away so I'm giving Colombia the edge with that one even though I only know like one guy on their team
Love that kit. I'm gonna say... 2-0 USA and 2-1 Colombia over the baby nats 😕
Predictions?
REPPING MY US GEAR RN
You're not wrong...
Disrespectful
#BoomerSooner
It did make me laugh 😂
Did you actually mean her?
Your honorable mention 😂😂😂
I respect it but no way she's top 5
Also Brian I saw an article that said something about tickets starting at $35 but don't quote me on that
Dem hips tho
And yeah I just randomly remember thinking she was hot 😂  I had to look her up
That was hard to choose honestly. But good picks on Emma Stone and Anna kendrick

She's the recent bae I don't really wanna order it tbh
1. Ariana Grande
2. Zooey Deschanel
3. Mila Kunis
4. Natalie Portman
5. Lacey Chabert
Duh, you've gotta stand up for your bf
http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/sports/2016/03/21/0321-columbus-to-host-soccer-match.html
Yeah new England left me down bad 😔
Tonight would be perfect for me but I don't think anyone else could.. 
Who's chillin?
Wow sportscenter? WE MADE IT
But they're the only way Niel is gonna stay out of last place
I never do
Video or I don't believe it
ily2
That game was so meh. And they just cannot win
Well. Looks like the Yale dream is over
Lol alright that's fine
Coo coo
Like get there then?
Up to you! We're free now we can head over there around 6?
Nick pizza is on Julie's parents 😉
Of course!
No that's fine with me! It's her offer actually
My guy. And okay that's cool
She's got the house to herself
Bball and chill at Julie's tonight? We can bring clix
Florida
Well I'm not making any excuses, they just weren't good this year
😔😔😔
I have no shame it's a good school
Ohio pride
F L Y E R S
Yeah mine's almost over 😭😭😭
Oh I don't blame you I put mine together in a minute or two
Craig are you that last place bracket in the group?
Yeah I was feeling Seton Hall hard
Also that guy was so done 😂
Yeah we're doing cedar point
Not by then I don't start until June 1st
No we have not. And idc I'm down for that though. Also Niel we never got it actually figured out
Don't apologize to him
Hey Nick
Oh...I know. Except I'm gonna lose this Arizona vs Wichita state game
I'm always down to chill
thx guys
You snooze you lose pal
sUcK iT
It's usually around now. There should still be people there on spring break
The field's always open Craig
Yeah on the bright side the Bayern juve game is pretty good
Well 😕
So Nick you're team #wengerout?
I remember when you guys were obsessed with her back when we played for pride because of that show
Those eyes
So jeal
Love her 😩
It looks funny
It does 😂
20g 😂😂
Why?
Also Brian I think that's a thing
That made me laugh so hard for some reason
Oh yeah they're cool but we're 0-2 with them... I mean let's face the facts they're cursed
The new kits are bad juju
Aww man we went. You didn't miss much though
Yeah... That was disappointing. Were you at the game?
HB ZSWAG
Did you sit down though?
Have you heard anything back from those two?
Sorry fam 😪
At this point just keep letting it go. I don't understand how you surpassed me so greatly in the beard growing department
I love it though
O Canadaaaaaa
Coming right up fam
Yeah the raptors one is pretty cool
Prob next weekend
Which weekend?
Niel my spring break is next week
Oh man I remember that pic. That's like sophomore year wow
Well then there is no helping you 😂
No but at least pick up one or two of thrm
So many
Giovinco, larin, piatti, feilhaber...
Other than Kamara you have nobody on your team that is an obvious point getter
Yeah that's a start...
How's that working for ya
I'm sorry Niel but I'm still laughing at that picture. The irony is so beautiful
Hey you were just feeling it all out first week...now you're gonna make changes and go undefeated from now on
I hate Portland
BY PIPA
YESS
I didn't realise 😳
Trapp is more like beckerman
I don't hate him
Zardes is not that great. And yeah I wish the USA v Colombia game was closer because I'd love to see that
I think so yeah. And we'll you can't really blame jozy he was out immediately
You don't anymore?
I still think the red bulls will be good just maybe not quite as good as last year. And then Toronto and maybe Montreal will be the biggest competition
League
And nah I think we should still expect to be among the top 3. We have the squad and experience
Maybe. We did get tarek though so if we need to we have depth
I want either that or the MLS cup and I'll be pleased
It's so dumb. I had to watch that
THAT'S THE SPIRIT
You guys have no faith. My prediction is 3-1 Columbus. Also I have no idea that pk was lame
Craig I said I liked yours last night!
Niel I love it 😂  I wish I could see the matchups!
Thanks I was trying to help McCoy come up with one last night and that one was too good to give to him 😂
381-422
Is Niel in this?
I laughed at both yours and Craig's haha I love a good player pun
I'm loving the team names guys (except you Brian)
Yeah I think I'll get drogba too
Both but I don't understand the app lol
You know... That's a good idea actually thanks
Get out of here I'm the champion. And I'm trying to get myself to make it now. I hate making squads for the first time 😩
Yeah idk what that is and I already have my app idea... But Nick approves so I assume it makes sense
I lost 3 clean sheets in the same minute
That team ruined club for me honestly. I'm jealous that McCoy has a fun team that's actually good
That was a good article and yeah I've seen that kind of thing so much lol
😏😏😏
Why are they all staggered 😭😭
I hate you. Also mine is the week after next week
I don't know who that is but I'm all for iy
Yeah this could be good for you!
I say go for it
I didn't even recognize him
Justin Cooper
Guys...
For the first week they're putting them all on Sunday I think
2?
I had firmino on my bench and Jesse lingard got put in for 14 minutes to keep him out of my lineup. Wtf
Brian do you have early class or would you wanna play some?
Nah lol I liked that on Facebook forever ago
Hey there's nothing gay about runescape
Same
We all have a bad week sometimes 😪
What did I ever do to you Craig
They're getting destroyed by a fetus
Really reassuring 😂
Seriously I will. McCoy said he's down. Anyone else?
Me neither honestly
Spring break
I wanna come down
It's pretty good... I mean not really the same though
We only just got it like a month ago
Like like like
I'm so excited to play together 😍😍
I just don't like the black
I like this recap
First place: Logan
Even I can watch them with like the 6 channels we get with those antennas... This is amazing
A little defensive but yes
proob
I tried to read that like 3 times
Actually it was even better he said he's a fan of obscure jerseys...literally my exact words!!!
I wore the Doumbia jersey for pickup tonight and immediately got a compliment. Thanks @Brian Hoffman 
They haven't
That was real pretty
I know there just a pretty big stat gap
Doesn't look like it to me...
I'm not, sorry :(
Yeah I'll have to go search for it but it's all good
I did not actually..
That's what I'm talking about
I approve then
I was so confused I thought the "cast" in the name was supposed to be  for Casto
You're dumb
Ohh
And Brian is after like a month
Also Craig is
Most of us
Where's Columbus??
Like in premier fantasy lol
Yeah that's def Emily's email 😂
loganpatino10@gmail
That, dodgeball, and white men can't jump were our go-tos for a while
Omg 😂
Nick you're so dramatic 😂
I'll still be there on weekends brahs
I'm really excited to see both my countries play in a competitive game though
It came out for them earlier this week b ri
That's beautiful 😂😂
I have no idea he's all I found 😂
Oh okay. Well that's still gonna take extra schooling!
What are you thinking now?
Says the guy who wants to go to law school...
Most likely
Goals
This was gold omg
I don't even know how to begin to pronounce it
#mourinhoin
#vangallout
My guy
???? 
Well Nick somebody's gotta hold down the cbus fort
Atta boy Niel
I'll try to be at a lot of games this year though and maybe I could get season tickets elsewhere
Sorry fam...I'll probably be relegated to a long distance fan
?
I actually have thought about it. Aren't they sold out though (
I know! That was a really fun game
https://youtu.be/txbRw-Waoyw

Start at 41:30 and just watch the rest, we show up a few times!!
Guys a bunch of us ended up in a crew supporters video!!!
Omg I did too I was like well we're screwed
Brian is strictly a Jake Miller fan
I didn't realize champions league was back!
What game?
He's straight out of a cartoon
hb @Nick Casto 
Shoulda sent a pic
Villa... wyd
That was lit
I have no idea what that means
Nick "Doumbia" Casto
So much power in the shot that you went down 😂
Wherever Doumbia goes I will follow
Yeah I found out the other day when I couldn't find him on FIFA. Well...
Did anyone else know my boy is on Newcastle?
They screwed up my fantasy week already
fav
That's weezy. Get with the times Brian
I just listened once I don't really remember!
I listened to that one actually it is pretty good
I thought it came out yesterday?
wtf
No 4 would be perfect. We'll all be done by then and we can go eat before the game!
Well I wouldn't say party 😂  When are you gonna be here?
I'm a real friend
I read that it's just a one year thing
It's a subtle gradient thing
I think there could've been some better execution but I'll take it
I said I liked its uniqueness! 
I never said I didn't like it
Nick my thought on it is if they're gonna make the top funky just go wild with the rest so I'll take the shorts
Hold on Niel
What kind of Columbus kid are you
It's the colors of the flag. The flag is literally on the jersey
It'll def be a collector's item someday!
I like the idea though
Unfortunately not a lot of people are really into the flag here or even know what it looks like
The brand is already unique. They just wanna connect with Columbus more
And yeah we didn't have the best material to work off of 😂
And I will say I like the uniqueness
Craig our black from last year is the new home kit
Black is home, this is away
I mean it looks okay. and as a shirt it will still be unique
yeah that was the painful part
They just look very disjointed
The presentation is painful
Yeah I'm watching now lol
Dang too late :/
I didn't actually I hadn't looked it up
Thanks for the support Brian
And yeah it could look better in person.
Also I read last night that the crew will be bringing back the yellow kits for select games like a third kit, so it's not all bad
At least it's mostly yellow?
Ehhh... I'll just hope maybe the leak is a bit off..
We just did it. Nice
I think it would be a game but I'd bet on Leicester
Leicester has kept like 5 clean sheets in the last 7 games and has the most goals scored in the league
Leicester
Hey I'm always down for whatever. I've never been invited to uc
When do they start playing?
I would grace your presence, yes
*THE Logan Patiño
I wouldn't mind going to one
😔
Also I meant family of animals in general
Nothing they are your children and deserve to grow up in a safe environment
Niel this is no place to raise a family of dogs
What's going on??
That's scary af. Kudos to you for talking to him honestly
Did anything happen or they just walked in? That's really scary
That's what made me think about it. I got out bread and nobody showed up 😢
He was an awesome dog. I'm just glad to get it off my chest because I didn't really wanna think or talk about it much yesterday
It was literally within a span of a few days that we knew anything was wrong
Xander passed away yesterday morning 
Guys,  since we're all family I feel like there's something you should know
You didn't reach the man fun you wanted though 
Why would you cut it why not just keep growing??
Let's see it 
The masters isn't super important for computer science only because there are good jobs without it. It might be cool though 
That is pretty awesome. They have a program like that here too but I don't know if I'll do it or not 
me rn
Believe me I'm not happy about it
Yeah I'm all in on the Tottenham hype train
I dropped ozil this week he really disappointed me
He's just too good
I wouldn't mind it it'd be cool to see him in the prem
Newcastle winning the league confirmed
Wil is just a fundamental guy. Next Kyle beckerman basically
Out of all of them you think tchani has the most potential??
I think they'll try to get most players in and at worst they're probably like 2nd string at their positions
I'm wearing my crew jersey for the cbus trio
3:45 on ESPN2 I think!
but Nick 😪
We grown
@McCoy Patino 


hb
Me
Fa cup unfortunately
RIP in peace my feathered friend
Yes they literally had to fish his body out of mirror lake 😪
😭😭😭
Brian's gonna start using it now
I was gonna say 30 and I was still too old wow
A camping trip could be done on a long weekend which would be nice
I'm always down for whatever
What about Craig and Niel? And yeah I liked last year
I will check soon
Nah see j Mac cost a lot. So we saved some money there. And then we got rid of schoenfeld. Now we got casey who probably didn't cost too much. Opening roster and cap space for...
Yeah I saw a bunch of those tweets...I don't understand
😏
Looks like Minnesota and Wisconsin
Yes let's make it a tradition 😂
Do it on a weekend and I'm there
Nick fr have a party
That's what being 21 is all about just ask Niel and Brian
Down for all of that
I don't know where or how you found that but same
👀
but yes
Well I don't think I'd call it a resurrection, considering you never have been
Niel honestly...I'm proud of you.
I love that you answered 😂😂
It was so mean lol I was having a bad day and just didn't wanna hear a bad joke
Also Brian not bad but it doesn't fulfill the requirements of the class :(
I'm pretty sure kolin petty is actually the one who told her that
😊
It sounds so much more smooth looking back. I was a real ladies man back in the day
I feel so exposed
Yeah don't do that again
That sounds cool! And what games?
Setup looks clean
Halo 5??
@Craig Casto 
omg
MY GOALIE AND DEFENDER NO
😂 we haven't decided yet but we still have a couple weeks
gg nick
Yeah I traded arnautovic
Hence my pic
I know. McCoy convinced me last night to pick lukaku over him 
Highly recommended
What a great week to transfer in firmino 😊
Pretty much anything. It just needs to have an interface, to use some external service (like maps), to hold data, and to use a phone sensor. But I can build off of any ideas
I'm just messing with you I mean I've played the game before lol
If anyone has a cool phone app idea that my group can use please speak now
What happened to you
Yeah I did but I didn't really get any responses. The company does look cool though
Thanks! And yeah, they give interns housing at Cleveland state so I'll have a dorm there. 
Westlake, it's like 20 minutes left of Cleveland. It's at a company called Hyland Software. And nick Idk like every few weeks or so it'll be all good!
Weekends!
Finally something going right for my team ❤
@Brian Hoffman 
I'm assuming not
I'm annoyed because I was so close to picking him up last night and took payet instead
McCoy did but I haven't yet 😪  @Brian Hoffman

My school's liberal arts and we don't need a religion class. But I guess it could fit with the whole treating patients thing
Why do you have a religion class?
I haven't done much yet but the classes all seem interesting
Says you of all people 
fml
js
First day of second session and I'm bringing up the rear 👍
Just FYI to everyone, prem games start back up today
A mobile app design class
Lol no but it actually is kind of an art class
First class was strictly syllabus and let out of early 😊
😂😂 it's in the process!
The day I do I will come to you for help ❤
I'd want that to be my own thing and this is for McCoy and I to share
Yeah I know all that and someday I'd like to but not now
I am not worthy
s'ready 😈😈😈
v good. The packages got there a few hours ago
Well my first class is at 5:30 but I'll let you all know how much syllabus time I get
😪
You can just give it to Sarah (she'd better not be)
Hey I mean if she didn't tell me I wouldn't know any better...
I heard that's amazing!!
U 2 THAT GAME WAS AWSUM
I got a CSKA Moscow Doumbia jersey from Brian
!!
Convince him plz
Yep I'm down for that
I'm free all day
Whenever!
Yeah mane
Either 5:50 or 9:10 for me!
Niel when are you getting your jersey??
Okay. It doesn't even have to be an overnight thing since you'll be leaving the next day but I'd love to come over and play a bit
Okay. Wednesday maybe? Or Tuesday before star wars?
What time Thursday?
Craig give me a reasonable answer and I'll drop it
I just don't understand why you need to leave tomorrow??
Craig. One more day for a fifa tournament
Bring Craig kicking and screaming if you need to.
Yeah so come whenever
That's why I was thinking if we started around 6 we could be done before too late
I think so
Tonight you don't have to. When can you tomorrow?
What is this in??
Craig you can't run away forever
Really whatever's doable for everyone
Sooner rather than later... Maybe get started at like 6? Anyone else have an idea?
Alright guys for the tournament tomorrow (and this includes you Craig): we're playing fifa 15 and the rule is we all pick a 4 star team (or lower) and then you get to transfer 3 players into your chosen team. And we're going to do the round robin idea we mentioned about a week ago
Nick it's all good.
This is Friday night though
THE FINAL JERSEY HAS ARRIVED
If we get everyone together then yeah I'm cool with that
It's almost exactly the same for me
Yeah why?
Whenever we all get together! Someone from the first through third
😳 it's all good I get it lol
If you needed to go to the mall you could join me. And wow way to go we could've watched them together 😡
During or after?
I might go spend some gift cards
We still have a few days so there's a chance!
I'm s'down
Hot af
Y
I just need to know...
Craig you can't be embarrassed you asked for it
I'm gonna need pics
I was too slow on the gif searching
Yep they were sitting right by the goal!
Alright I left a sweatshirt there too so I picked them both up
Craig did you bring a mount Carmel hoodie to the field yesterday?
You said you wanted me to send you the map. And McCoy needs it to send out the pics
WHAT IS YOUR EMAIL
NICK
Nick what's yo email
I just sent it to you
What's your email Craig?
loganpatino10@gmail
Also zach it's all good just let us know
Yeah you can send money to someone if they don't have the app
You can use Google wallet for it. I'm down if everyone wants
@Craig Casto and @Zach Spangler you guys want to come over tonight? It'll make it easier to get up for tee off at 9 tomorrow ;)
I'm down with either. We can do a sleepover since we're soccer golfing in the morning!
I'm all for it!!
Yessir
Uhhhh 👀
I don't need to train to beat you craig
Ninny and pop are getting here! And just dinner and stuff. Feel free to come chill whenev
Well I just took a shower so :/
Imma guess grandparents
1-3 we can figure it out. That's when we'll do the tourney and the exchange. Christmas eve we'll do the soccer classic 
I'm cool with Christmas eve then
I hope so! Although Zach said he might be busy
Just got my jersey! Who all doesn't have theirs?
Dang well never mind then. Not a fun few days 😔
Or you and McCoy can come with Julie and I to das
We can watch arsenal get smashed later
Whenever!
ily @Nick Casto 
Wow nick you're making us look bad
How is that audacious at all? He scores or assists like every game
I'm good with either back to back on the 23rd or just keeping the classic on Christmas eve and doing the fifa tourney later. Preferably the first option
It doesn't have to be overnight just later that day
Good though it's all up to Niel now
WE SAID THAT LAST YEAR
@Niel Skalican @Zach Spangler and everyone else what are you doing the 23rd. We're thinking this could work for the SOCCER Classic and the FIFA tournament
Oh okay jerk
Same 😂  Wait you mean in two hours?
Whenever I just need to get up and eat!
I'm down
No
Hey Brian
Hey Brian
I'm cool with it too
I don't
Honestly I'm down for either
What a loser
Brian you're in the middle
#teamnoballs
Thanks Niel you understand me <3
Craig fr though...ouch
Why can't you love me this much Niel
Niel whatchu got against baylee
This all isn't necessarily happening. I mean like Niel said you know the situation better than anyone else. Just be aware
Woah now he never said they were actually going to end things. Nick I do think you should try and work it out just don't be a pushover if it really bothers you
I guess but you've gotta stand strong
No I mean why is she working out with him don't stand for that
Why??
Who's skip?
Of course!
Yeah I'm worried about mine tbh
😔
Yeah I'm not blaming her for the distance thing either because that's tough but the whole ex thing is unfair
The feeling is still there... That's not fair to you. She has to understand that
If she said that she still is in love with him then yeah. I agree with Niel. She's got to figure that out and you shouldn't be taken along for the ride
I was just thinking because she didn't mention it. But yeah that's tough because there's really nothing you can do about that. I mean neither of you really knew how you'd handle the distance before all this though
Maybe wait out Christmas break and see how that goes...but it sounds like she betrayed your trust and I would have to have a serious talk about where to go before keeping up the relationship
Nick that sucks and I'm really sorry. I did see her working out with some guy but I had no idea it was her ex and hoped it wasn't a big deal. I really hope it all works out whatever the outcome
Yeah man I'm just helping her make those gainz we'd all do the same thing!
❤
You are truly a changed man
Says the kalin and Myles fan
POPPIN PILLS IS ALL WE KNOW
DONT YOU LET OUT THAT ANTIDOTE
No you should not
Sure you do 😏
So grateful I don't have tests like that
#doshiguaines
Our profile has gone up so much we'd sign...Gonzalo higuain
That's weird
Yeah I saw that
My answers are exactly the same as Niel's
Yeah she did so it's all good lol
Yeah I just waved and said hey. I wasn't sure if she'd recognize me tbh
Yep the RPAC I think this is the first time I've ever actually seen her on campus lol
Nick I just saw ya gurl
@Niel Skalican 
There's still some time after that
Oh 😂😂
Niel when will you be back from your excursion?
Dad's legacy?
That one is no surprise. So our signings this year were either really good fits or cut after one season lol
@Brian Hoffman 
Oh snap sorry Brian
Oh that's fine we usually kick off around 1 in the morning anyway
Niel if I don't see you all break I'm coming down to Cincinnati and punching you in the neck.
Last finals day for everyone? Mine is the 15th
Nah I still like higuain
Yeah I thought that too. Our midfield is our best thing and I don't really want to upset that balance
I still like meram though... Just maybe not as much as cedrick. And yeah we need some more center back depth
I know who I want to play
With kristinn? Nobody
Yeep. We're not gonna be there quite at 1:30 but we'll be there by 2
Ya
Nick what do you think parking will be?
That fine we won't be able to anyway lol
At like 12:30. We just thought of it this morning though and Julie's not up yet so Idk if we'll be able to
Why??
We were planning on eating already so that works out most likely
Maybe...where at?
Whatchu mean?
u wot m8
We're going to campus around 12:30 and trying to get to the stadium at 1:30
Btw my jersey has been purchased
WHY ARE YOU SO PESSIMISTIC
Nah we're good
Stop
So
I'm down for whatev (also Craig we scored on you all day)
The Columbus Crew are winning 5-1 tomorrow according to our fifa prediction 
That gif was perfect and I respect that
Niel I think you're saying something but I can't hear you from all the way down there
I don't wanna hear it from you Brian. Mr. Mid Table
Niel... You suck
jk
I hate you guys
@Niel Skalican 
Dang that's expensive I didn't realize that. And I agree lol if I get one I'll wait.
30 bucks is probably around the right price though. I'd guess $20-30
Yeah a little bland but cool regardless. and the tweet didn't say. They start going on sale Saturday at 10
I agree. And maybe spread it out a bit
Guess what...I'll be there at 1:30
Yeah I saw they are selling MLS cup scarves! I definitely want to be there when the gate opens
I'm not sure. I only saw something about the stadium opening at 2
Early. What time are you?
That is beautiful
Either or will be fine I think
Ah okay. You still think it'll work?
And I do have mine from last game I think
I would like to get in. What do you mean still print tickets?
I have not and do not want to lol
I saw that actually lol
Same tbh it still hasn't hit me that we're ACTUALLY going to watch them play in the final
Well I'm glad they chose today to be off on finishing
They were just trying to hold on
Yeah you're not missing this
THAT WAS WAY TOO SCARY
Finlay needs to finish something
*Finlay
I know. I'm just saying I'm pretty sure we were second highest scoring and regardless I see us getting one. and no matter how good they are I do not see them getting 4
I don't either. We're a lot stronger mentally than last year
It was really nice. That would've been an awesome way to (hopefully) advance
Yeah we really just need that one. But I'm confident we can score
Scary stuff but we've definitely had the better chances
Scratch that. Crew repeat the 2-0 result and red bulls fold as an organization
Nice. I say 2-1 red bulls
😃😃😃😃
Omg
This is it... Win and we HOST
I'm hoping. I've accepted not making it though
😂😂 you've gotta give it up
Very true but come on. He joined a week late
Niel...
When are you done Brian?
I didn't actually see, what happened?
My boy ❤
You can search for gifs in the app
I guess that makes me level 8 too because I best him the other day too
But it's unfair... Craig's a level 7 ping pong master
I've gotta get on that soon
Who else has it?
I'd like to do 16 if possible
Sounds good to me!
😪
I can't I've gotta pack up and be up early
I'm home!!
Regarding the qualifier though that'd be pretty awesome
We don't talk about that
We're practically a rich team in these playoffs!
And Dallas is second lowest
The group chat name speaks the truth
I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D HAVE THE CHANCE
3-1 omg THERE IS A CHANCE
Yeah if we host we'll figure it out. And Niel I think it's weird too but I'm not complaining. And they just give you the money back
Idk I'm hoping someone can get me in the nordecke
I got the cheapest ones for a little over $40
Assuming we win and Portland wins it's here! And Dec 6 at 4!
McCoy, Julie, and I all have our tickets 😎
I'm getting on RIGHT NOW
We're leaving OSU rn
Come over Niel
I'll be there
After Nick's work!
It's all good. And I'm down for it
Prob not then 😔
Because of the cold though most people will probably go play indoor instead
Not rainy but yeah pretty cold
Idk how many people will be out but we can chexk
I'm still down if you want
No he cannot
Yeah he is
Wait Brian you play??? It looks so fun
Yeah rocket league looks awesome actually I've wanted it but can't play it
Yeah forward that message to us
We leave Wednesday. And I'm not sure I don't have plans at the moment
Not this you dumb. And they wanted to have people see the new place. He'll be here for Christmas though
???
How does one craze heroclix
We're going down to south Carolina for thanksgiving with the gparents
I just realized McCoy and I are gonna be gone most of break... 😔
I'm always down
Niel... You are forgiven
I will never forget because that was redemption for all the times we played back in the day 😂
Niel let's be real...you can't even beat me at 21
@McCoy Patino 
Both at the same time, duh
Crew game??
So Niel while you're here
Honestly idk I don't really keep up with them
Messi's hurt so yeah you can't even really fairly compare. And ronaldo will probably be right back to his usual in like a few months and then you'll forget you ever said this
Brian wtf is your avatar
WHY are you sucking up to Brian
The man, the myth, the beard
Did you finally?
I have seen the dank in person
Zach where are you?
I can get there in like 5 min tops
I get out of class at 12:30 and I just told Julie we were gonna run over there asap!
I will just let me know!
Yeah right!
That sucks. And isn't there a guest one?
You're not gonna be there all day?
I would but I have class 8-9:20 😫
I just got here too! So wait what are you here for?
There's a garage yeah
Zach time??
I saw that!! Def buying
I didn't have class today anyway so 😑
I mean Niel???
Nick you can really go??
It's at 5 I'm pretty sure
Niel I would be happy to see you again
😂😂😂
Brian buy his ticket
That seriously sucks. But the least I can do is try to find someone to buy your ticket for yoy
He just bought one today lol. Why can't you go??? 😪
They even broadcasted two games wtf
IMAGINE BEING THERE. MY POOR THROAT
WHAT A GAME
2-1 Columbus. Jack McInerney scores the winner in the 120th minute
???
Sorry lol I don't think I do
Seriously you were trying to tear the family apart
"wasent"
Does a one-legged duck swim in a circle?
Yeah it should be solid!!
Yes sir I went the whole 9 yards and got the playoff package
You can't say no at this point
Oh I know what that is! I got an email from school asking for volunteers and I almost did it because it sounded interesting
I agree with you. A piece of him is still in Massachusetts somewhere
Wait Zach are you going?
Beautiful insight, Zach. Thank you
Fine wine
I'll give some mammograms
I doubt MIT is really a big part of that
High five Craig 🙏
To be fair to my school, Ohio state's athletic program is self-sufficient
Niel you would retweet a Swedish national team tweet
Alright and alright
Yeah I'm at the soccer game vs Michigan and it's actually packed it's pretty cool
Oh you had it right I called him back
What'd you say?
I just saw the MLS cup with my own eyes
What does he want?
Assisted by rafffffffffael
That's awesome! And we are doing it. Should we start texting Julie whenever?
I think so
Julie and I will!
Yeah I hope your other half of the prediction is correct too
😂😂
Finlay was being shut down
How do you lose that there
Idk but that was ugly
FLAIR
Nick you sound bitter
I do agree with that prediction though. Maybe 2-2
Just because we're all fans doesn't mean we all think we're gonna win
Score predictions?
Who were you saying would ball out though?
Niel: good call
 That's my boy 😄😄😄
I'm excited too it should be good. I shouldn't be so worried about one guy but Drogba is pretty much good for a goal a game
So how're you guys feeling about playing Montreal?
Ol' Donovan tickets. That's because turf = 👎
Did you see the defense on EVERY goal?
They're going all the way hence the group chat name
That picture is incredible
Galaxy out in the first round makes me so happy
Yeah that show is really bad about that
Omg yes I didn't know what you meant by max air. That was so hilarious I thought someone was gonna get hit by all those coins 😂😂
I feel like I do vaguely... Remind me
We never decided there would be a shield winner!
Let's settle it this way. If we both get some sort of message telling us we won something then you get that and I get the cup
Funny thing is I took out davies for adi and davies had a pretty good day that would've made it less tense
Brian it was a really good final. And no I don't think so
🏆
He doesn't score very much
Yeah I really did not see him getting two goals
That's why I don't say anything because you never know
I said earlier if big celery scores we win the cup for sure...
J A C K
M A C
A T T A C K
Stevey clark
 "Fake chow"
Zach I see that you have our group chat muted and I am hurt
We can start the jersey exchange stuff whenever right?
At the very least I was entertained
Fifa is usually Brian. Other things though
To be fair to nick he's generally been pretty good in competitions
Niel you are ruthless today 😂😂
This is great 😂😂
👀👀👀
Okay lol. Yeah he's been on there for a while though so who knows when that happened
Is he in right now?
Really? I've had him for like 2 months then lol
Guys I just found out I'm playing for the final in MLS fantasy today
Yeah it went the other way real quick 😪
Why can't you go?
lol @ tottenham
Big day! Go city!
Don't hate me!
Still looking pretty dreary. I'm not sure there's gonna be much of a crowd
Assuming it doesn't rain!
Craig you dead
It's a larp clan Brian. Please.
It looks like a chance of rain... Temperature looks good though
That sounds awesome and speaking of playing nick I'm good for Saturday
Brian that was messed up 😂😂
I'll have to see if Julie wanted to do anything but as of right now I'm down
Saturday? I could be down for dat
Doumbia scored on man u. He cannot be stopped
Bout to be LIT and why not?
Ew
Ew
I guess I was gonna have to fess up sooner or later
Even football players want to be him
He was a born Andre but we still need to find our places
Oh believe me I am!!
Yeah I was gonna say I don't follow with the flower shop and thin pants
😂😂😂  I will happily be ruxin he's the coolest one
Don't McCoy and I have to be Pete and taco?
Please 😂😂
Of course you always have been
So who am I playing??
Sounds like a boo the way they do it
Zeeeeeeeeeeeekeeeee
I know. And it's really weird to see OSU in black lol but they're pretty sexy
These jerseys are nice
I was freaking out like how
WOW
We're looking really good!
😂😂😂😂
Loftus check!
Nobody it was a pitiful attempt
You guys suck
The Brutus one is good
We tried that remember??
That cannibal pumpkin is amazing. and this isn't a proposal 😂
Sorry to change the subject but I have an important question. Julie and I are about to carve pumpkins and I need everyone's opinion on what to make. I'll give everyone until 8:10 to give your suggestion and I'll pick my favorite. Also McCoy, if Craig doesn't get this just tell me his
🙌🙌🙌
😭😭😭
Hit the question marks. Yeah they mean like $1 million plus
I remember you telling me about that 😂😂😂
We are in a no-judgement zone... I respect your opinion Zach
Also...good point Zach. It's for SURVIVAL
Hitler was a real OG
If we had all the smartest people only passing genes along though we would be a super race
It's more about being ethical at that point 😂
Yeah but I mean you can't just tell people not to reproduce!
Yeah that's impressive. And in a way way less insensitive way I could say that ideally I would love for certain people to not reproduce necessarily and that we'd be better off with others passing genes along but I mean that's just so messed up 😂
😡
But in reality yours has been the most conservative so there's some truth to that
Brian you are a straight up old man Jeffers from southern Alabama
What percent is Bernie?
Haha yeah I noticed McCoy's was longer than yours and tried to do every one. I'm also bad about really picking a side for like the somewhat thing lol
Yep I'm not too surprised by that lol
Same apparently!
Brian's is fairly different
Alright time to do mine
YA COMMIE
Quite a mouthful. Brian's a leftie too
Brian trump was surprisingly high for you
McCoy it's true
I'll do it soon
How long does that take?
That seems pretty difficult... And I had no idea
Now how do you figure that...
😂😂😂
Yeah the one against Honduras right?
You mean yesterday?
Yeah my biggest fear is that wil finally starts getting into the national team consistently and is played out of position
Pretty much never I'm just saying he's that weapon
Hey yedlin is a pretty fast wing
Woah now...this is not a young team
The game isn't until 9:30
Nice pic btw
For?
Oh I know. Feel free to change it whenever you can search for a pic from the app
Did you see it was actually a gif?
Doesn't matter either way. Although I set the group picture just for you 😉
I'm guessing ESPN
That's a good point I just always think it makes so much sense for him to play there
I agree with just about all of that. I was gonna suggest maybe Cameron but I'm fine with he or Brooks. Also fine with guzan. And maybe have Dempsey play underneath of jozy instead of with him up top
I understand that. I'm fine either way honestly guzan would just have the edge for me. And I could see both of them starting
I don't think it's a very big step down though. And I'm okay with that little step down for someone who's been with the team consistently lately
I just got the app but I never had problems without it the past month. And even though he hasn't been with the team?
Have faith!! Although I'm a bit nervous
Craig why
I forgot about that. Alright sounds good
Oh I didn't know you were home! Well Julie and I were gonna do some pumpkin carving while we watched...that sounds really fun though so I'll ask her what she thinks
Ya boi
Nick you're optimistic?? I'm watching at home
Easily. And I'm gonna say...3-2 USA
Oh yes I am. And who do they play?
Hey guys I was using this app for a project class at school and it works really well for group messages. That way McCoy and I won't have weird issues with images and missing things so if you're cool with it I wanna use this
Don't stop the vision
19 days from graduation mccoy
We're fam
I love spending time with all of you
Jumping to insults
Logan
Whoa
Damnit guys
Saturday before Easter??
1st title
Winner
Guys I might actually win something
It's between me and nick now
Problem solved
Guys let's all root for cincy tonight
Thinking of me leads to good things
Yeah, don't value yourself off of her though, you're great man
Different days will be better and worse, just try to do things that make you happy and distract your mind, during the day at least 
It's the worst man, I'm sorry
Want to help in any way I can
I can somewhat relate to your state of mind right now and that song would help me out 
@Zach Spangler Listen to Alaska by Maggie rogers
Brian doesn't 
Is that where you're going?
It doesn't
Not yet
Nah 62-55 now
I will say that bucknell pick was dumb 
Chill 
Now only 7
They were down 16 
Logan I respect the Cincinnati final four pick
I don't think you can add one after the games have started :/
If you're in cincy at all this week Zach we can hang if you want 
Really just a stark reminder that people are inherently shitty at heart 
It's all so shitty
Really sorry Zach
Just rejoin hardwood poetry
Tournament challenge?
Don't forget rattlesnakes too
Steelers maybe though
Or else I would stay in cincy
Haha college bball is not a factor in this decision
Leaning Arizona for now
Arizona throws you in there right away
I think Pittsburgh is more classic and you have to prove yourself the first year before they make you an assistant to a professor 
This will be somewhat of a painful one considering they both offer something completely different
The only one left is Cincinnati 
Yeah it is
No I thought it would be dumb for me to try for osu but maybe I should have
She knows I'm leaving cincy 
No
Yeah fortunately for grad school that out of state cost goes out the window
Have you guys been to Pittsburgh? It's a cool city
I think right at it, like 7 spots
Tucson would be a vacation spot for you guys though
Pittsburgh top 40 and Arizona 45
Pittsburgh has a little more prestige though..
Pittsburgh is offering a little bit higher of a stipend
Tuition is covered for both
Where do I go
Yeah..no one knows why yet
I'll be in Europe most of May, and then will have to work all summer so it's not looking likely
Myrtle beach I can't commit yet
Whoa I'm still here
City , zip?
@poonslayer What's your address?
I'm most likely going out to Arizona in the fall, got accepted to their phd program. 
Ahh I'm coming next weekend to play
Decided to not be angry and go on the side of it all being for the best
I would rather be friends then not anything, considering this is someone I spent every day with for 5 years
I mean I already went through all of the shock and devastation of her hooking up so there's not much more that can really get me back to that place. I'm fine now, this is the new normal.
I'm doing better overall, it was rough last weekend
We made up, agreed to be friends
I'm down for flying or driving anywhere
Yeah I agree 
I would say not 100%
If you want to keep it healthy
Umm I wouldn't say that
Well..yeah, you got to confront her on that
Oh shit
She wants you to go I think
Women do that..
I think so
Since you won't go
She might be trying to make you jealous too
Yeah it's reasonable to say you don't want them in the same room, at the same time it doesn't change much because it's not like he can't come into her room..I don't know 
You're in a tough spot then
I know 500 is a lot but it might be worth it now
Obviously emphasize you trust her, but that he's the worst
Got to talk to her about that
I can try red boxing it and bring it up there
Can we do stuffed crust?
Sounds good to me
Yeah! when is later?
There is good food near me! It can be worth it to come get me!
Heeeey
I can venmo gas money? Sorry I hate being this guy 
Hey I'm available now..slight problem though, my bro is using the car I was going to use for the day
Haha alright Thursday then this is your city so you got the plans
Yeah let's hang tonight
So you can actually hang with me then?
Hey I'm definitely there for the soccer CLASSIC
What's everyone doing Thursday night?
That's what you said can't take it back now!
Logan still owes me a night out where he buys everything
Also, my jersey will not be on time, but I've been wanting to hang out I just figured everyone was busy
Hey I'm definitely there for the soccer CLASSIC
Hey as quick as you can when does everyone go back to school for spring semester?
Just about freeing up the time for it. 
Umm I definitely want to be
Hanging out by myself
I'm in Columbus 
I do
Sounds horrible man
Wow, so wrong
But to be honest I sort of am more ok with it now the more I think about it
Yeah, I thought he was good for Germany 
But I don't know, now this sort of cements we aren't going anywhere
Yeah I think it's fair to say he wasn't the right fit with American soccer culture 
You don't fire the coach you've had for 6 years in the middle of the hex
Those teams are just better
I mean I feel like those losses would happen anyway
Why would they fire him
Landon Donovan named as captain
So dumb 
What
Buuuut I might be able to come Friday night depending on what happens on Saturday for where I work, they might cancel, might not
I don't know what an inverted polynomial even is
I'm going to withhold most of my views/analysis, but to respond to your question nick his support is probably better summarized to being dependent on rural non college educated whites rather than among gender differences. Many women voted for him.
Everyone vote today?
I would say no if it was 48 in group stages, but just a little knockout round to start off would bode well for entertainment purposes, it starts off very tense, eases, and then gets tense again, who wouldn't love that?
It won't hurt, especially if you just select countries that can handle it
You don't need 100,000 plus seating
Boom
No they wouldn't
They have way less poverty
Japan, South Korea, China 
Argentina 
Canada, us, Mexico
Australia, New Zealand
All of Western Europe
I mean there are like 40 better options then those
Host it in developed countries and 48 teams is fine 
That's because they picked Brazil
Big deal
Yeah don't host them in South Africa, Brazil, and Qatar, good point
The olympics doesn't ever happen or anything
Oh my goodness because it's so hard to host 16 more teams
It's a good idea
Plus I love the intrigue of teams playing a one game elimination to get into the top 32
And it would provide a lot more than that
Upsets, underdogs, are important for tournaments
48 teams would make it better
African nations as well have more quality and need more teams represented
I mean look how stacked South America is, you think that those countries that don't get in aren't better then Honduras?
6-2 games are fun to watch too
If you're in the top 48 you're not Gibralter
I don't want to see the same teams play over and over throughout my whole life
It would be much more exciting if other nations were able to celebrate their country on that kind of stage
Several nations will NEVER have a chance to make it in the current format
People love the tournament more for the passion then the quality game to game
I don't understand how you can love march madness but then say this would dilute the tournament
The hex is not that special, 4 teams of the 6 get in 
I think they should do it
200 countries try to get in
What I though should*
But he doesn't have a cool head, and that's sort of what I should happen, but didn't expect with how the debate turned out
Yet he's trying to represent the people who all collectively pay the most into it
Well, the fact he has paid no income tax was a good point
My guess is she'll stay 3-5 points up in polls
When she*
But he barely touched it
Yeah, he could of went deeper went she brought up the Russia email hack, and talked about how she manipulated the primary
Other then, " I'm proud of this, I have these people who love me"
And he really didn't have any good response to it
The last hour she gave, calm, controlled responses and her criticisms of Donald were in no way unfair
But the rest he looked ridiculous, especially towards the end
Yeah it seemed she was doing poor when I turned it on 20 minutes in
What did you guys think
Shoot @Zach Spangler I didn't see that text until just now, I was at my MUN meeting and must of missed it. I've been really sick though, I can come to the rest of the games if you need someone for the rest 
He'll be back in the squad
#LD2018
Ahahahahahaha
Definitely interested just want to know the price
@Logan Patiño 
Hey Logan do you know anyone who does Model United Nations at osu?
We were up 16-12 in the 4th..
Oh well
Yeah it would of been nice to put ourselves on the map in football
But the fact we were in the game for so long makes me happy
That was a 4th quarter collapse if I've ever seen one
Hilarious
Honestly I didn't even know about that Hamilton score, but it's nice to hear the tide has turned in soccer dominance
But..in other news
Haha I read that earlier, our student gov last year were full of shady people
My Wednesday nights are pretty busy most of the time :/ sorry man would play if I could
I am absolutely awful at frisbee..when would it be?
He has to hear about something he did 20 years ago all the time
Poor harkes is just trying to get FC Cincy in the MLS
Went all in from one tweet 
Did not hold back
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh 😵
Yeah I agree sometimes he makes pretty bad judgements with certain players
That last catch was made by an HT guy
Honestly it was just a good play, it will be a blowout still
Hahaha
👀
Yep
Anyone willing to say mourinho has done a good job yet?
I don't even know if I would put bravo above him honestly
He makes some bad mistakes but he also puts in a lot of great performances
He's the best English goalie, I say still top 10 keepers in the world
If you want to bring in a better keeper fine, but benching him is uncalled for
It's not like he hurts the chemistry
He's better than caballero
Once he gets a handle on finishing he'll be one of the best midfielders
Sterling is so nice
He's world class
True, this game they've been playing a little dirty which has bothered me, and the way pep is treating hart
Mccoy are you still a united fan?
It's becoming harder and harder for me to support city
Yeah..something I can improve on
I'm surprised you wore it today though I thought you liked Tottenham
So worth the wait, right?
Decorate it*
You should tell him to decorate your t
Weird because UC's soccer team is always pretty sucky
Good luck mccoy!! Proud of you!
😂😅
I think we might get a win today
Someone's gotta be last place 
Sorry I'm late to this I was actually going to ask if we were doing it
nielskalican@gmail.com
Love you guys but that would be too much scrambling
Not enough time I blew it
I'm a failure
Go on without me
I overslept big time 😖😫😫😫
I'll be there at 8 if everyone else is down
If you guys do golf I could go around 8am, working osu fair at 12
Neighborhood soccer golf?
I don't know if I'll have a car to drive up but I should be in Columbus Saturday morning
Is there any way you can say I'll have 3-4 or 5-6 people with me or do you have to give an exact amount on a reservation?
Are they far from c-bus?
How early??
We all need to Pokemon battle
That's right
Got the starmie today 
I may be young but I got the desire
Hey I'm fighting to catch up!
They never have any gyms
I almost forgot there was a yellow team
😒
You guys are probably yellow
WHAT ARE YOU?
They need more than three teams
Valor
Are they going to release them?
Wow
Ohhhh 
I'm not spelling bee champ
How is it supposed to be spelled??
Guys I'm going to be 1st to catch muetwo
You have a car man drive down here!
I didn't see the comments before but they confirmed it was
It is fake..
I'm in cincy but I go back to c-bus to work the fair Monday and Tuesday
You guys have been out of the loop
Dee has
I bet there's a mue hanging around there
Find some good Pokemon in Toronto
I got excited..
Ah
What's that?
Is that a Charizard?
Jealous
Where are you
Every side of the stadium looks the same
Is it close to Lincoln
Still don't know where that's at
I'm next to the rpac
Which is where?
So where are you
Ok
Where are you
You said north
I just walked to the north!!
-__-
Where is that?
Where are you guys at
Everyone there?
Just crossed the scioto on King by foot
Alright sounds good 
@Nick Casto When do you guys want to go into the stadium?
Only a mile walk from where we'll park
Well my dad is already going so I figured it would be easier this way since he's heading up
Walking a long way
Up by grand view now
Yeah I've been in it
6:30*
Around 6 
Then what?
Where are you going first?
When are you guys coming to Columbus?
I won't be back until around 2 
@Logan Patiño 
To be the very best, like no ever was: 5
GOTTA CATCH EM ALL: 18
To find Pokemon: 7
Entertainment/fun:16
None: 1
Thanks!
She has to take an English so it's just intermediate comp and it's a paper that you have to pick a discourse community to write about, so she picked Pokemon go. 
Haha I'll let you know by the end of it, thanks!
Lexi is doing a paper on Pokemon go so if you guys could fill out this survey it would be much appreciated http://goo.gl/forms/TRq6APMBUhMVn8jy1
Awesome at least I get to hang with you guys there in a few days
Everyone is going to the Madrid game right??
Ah gotcha
Or driving 12 hours in a day?
Are you guys spending the night there?
I would love to, but I already don't make enough already with the job I have now, let alone not having one
But Toronto is awesome so hope you guys enjoy it
Note: you probably weren't counting me, but in case you were, I unfortunately cannot go
You guys are always better than me
I'm only 10
Wow
What level is everyone?
I liked their little motto best
Valor
So hard to catch for some reason too
So many zubats
Come play some soccer
Well, good thing cavs got it this year
What kind of monster does that
You can't be from Ohio and not root for Lebron
Haha I would probably do the same if that was me though honestly 
Just depends, feel the same here
I think that I can challenge you in sport knowledge
Haha yeah it's unfortunate
There's the answer to all of my absences
I'm 21 and have never owned a car
If GS get Durant then it's pretty much over for 3-5 years
Yeah LA has no idea what to do, no one wants to play for them
Conley highest paid player..I know he's  unique for his position but still..
Nba free agency is crazy too btw
But I've watched a lot of the euros/transfer market news
Yeah well when it comes to ownership stats and franchise info I'm pretty flat with knowledge
Anyway good convo
I feel like it was a 3-4 year slow constructed process but I can tell you have a genuine hate for me
Even Brian too even though he probably would rather do anything else
You guys should come down for another game
They got rid of their most marketable player too
Yeah that's a lot of money
Even when they were good last year they can never sell out stadiums
Yeah I don't know the crew are in a rut
Goodness
Lower parking prices
Make them cheaper
People
They just can't afford crew games
Poole in Columbus like soccer
Selling out stadiums gives you better concession sales
I mean they could try a few games out
Even Mexican
I mean they could have looked at European teams as a model
Because they feel like they have a great fan base 
Maybe the team would play better then
The crew could lower their ticket prices 10-15 bucks and more people would come
Like I said cincy made smart marketing decisions
I mean these decisions are mostly the fault of the club though
They could fix that if they wanted to
And inconvenience them, total agreement
Yeah, they make their fans pay a crap ton of money 
Also dumb
Dumb on their part
Yeah idk why the crew makes everything that expensive
How?
They have great fans because of the way they have marketed themselves and the coach they got, it doesn't take much to build a team up in this country 
Higher than Columbus attendance wise
Yeah pretty lame
Whoever the owner is
His/her
If his team is worse than some USL teams they shouldn't be in MLS
If they want their team to do well, get back to the MLS, they'll keep supporting
Ok but there never will be any of this until you start it up. The crew have their own tv audience and other MLS teams you just leak usl teams in too. If an MLS team gets relegated and loses their audience/fan base that's their supporters fault, they ultimately pay the price
Give me a break Finley had like 2 goals in that 4-0 game
If at all
The MLS teams are not that much more superior
Pretty sure Orlando did this year as well
Gosh I'm sorry that they lost an away game in their first year in existence as a soccer team playing in their first open cup they lost to a team they dominated possession in. The crew got knocked out last year to a team that wasn't in the MLS
Why not?
Ok so let teams like cincy try to top the table next year
That doesn't matter we don't all pay equally for Gerard and lampard to be in the league
I somehow think there is a loophole in that, why does LA and NYC get every player then and afford them? We don't equally all pay for everyone, some clubs in the league are richer than others
Got to think about the money and entertainment that comes in with promotion and relegation, how much excitement it generates/viewers 
I think we're beyond that point in this country where clubs are rich enough to get sponsors/players
Capitalism
They should of invested their money better then?
Good job you guys beat a team at home 4-0 and then lost to Chicago in the next round. Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
Some teams anyway
The lower leagues are pretty decent
Why not?
Goodness why is everyone bitter
12 game unbeaten streak tho!!
It's just fun to tick you guys off sometimes
I don't hate the crew
You guys would not beat us 5-0
How do you go from Mls final to almost worst team in the league?
Can we do promotion/relegation?
That's a good name 
But I don't know yet
Actually could go
I'll get back to you on that
I know the feeling
Mesut..
Goalkeeping Craig too
Playing styles
Haha sometimes but the resemblance is eery
I have 3 guys on my indoor team that play exactly like Brian nick and Craig
Guys like me again
Shots fired already
Woah 
A bunch of Cinderella teams
The Euros have been good though
 Thanks Logan
Shhhh there's still time for comebacks
Where are you watching the game
Kanye though I would pay 50-100
This is a good performance 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Zypyi3Dss9s
He's a hit or miss I feel like
The atmosphere would be great though
Those would be really fun
Woah why not?
Happy birthday Logan!!!!
Come see me too guys 
Ohhhhh balls to the face!
Improbable
Yeah no one even said anything about yesterday's improbably win
It's only the 15th
They're down 1-0 😥
#traitor
You'll know about them when they beat the crew real soon 
I mean I'm sorry I root for the team that's literally a 5 minute walk from where I live, didn't know that classified as one of my things "to be different"
US Open Cup 2016 we're taking
Jimenez 😳
Mls
I'll root for the crew in mod
No doubt I am
Cincy*
Just cut inside and shot
Didn't take much
Awesome
Do you need a YouTube account for that?
Well it's at 7:30 but thanks for telling me that
They're in Tampa
Can't stream it
That was so nice
Oh my
Oh man that's a must see
There you go it looks beautiful! Happy birthday!!
That's what I'm saying 
Cheaper tickets
Yeah instead of 5 it's 25 now
If they beat Tampa bay I'm going to Columbus
The crew will attract people
That was a game in the middle of the week 3 days after they broke the attendance record
We would bring more fans
Even the usl knows the open cup is a crap competition 
But at least both of those teams don't throw beer cans at opposing players!! 👏
Your pride team probably didn't have 8,000 more than the crew in attendance though 🙊
5-2-2 > 2-4-4
We have better possession and a better forward!
You guys will be severely outplayed
Be afraid guys
We're coming for the crew!
2-1 win tonight for the us open cup
No, I have work
Every week a couple times, why?
Yessssss
I hate you for avoiding me 
Yep I have like 3 different pairs
Yeah you could
Hilly and muddy as heck
It's cross country x 1000
1 hour 23 minutes, but times don't really matter in these kinds of races.
10.6 miles
I was second for a while got passed at 4 miles
Yeah we both go at our own pace
It's super long and muddy 
She never hated you
She's running still
Just got third place 
No problem nick thanks everyone for coming down!
And they took Cedrick off
Kevin Doyle
Nooo
Logan you alright?
Haha no I didn't know I was coming so I didn't bring them to Columbus but you'll get them tomorrow!
2145 Brett ct
Sounds good, I'm at Lexi's so get off on the alum creek exit and turn right, then left at the Sunoco in that neighborhood. It's in Brett Ct so you can gps it, I'll give you the full address in a second 
If that's alright with you
Yeah!
You guys back from the gym?
Alright let me know
Any time you can get me
Then we can hang out tonight and tomorrow since I haven't seen you guys in like over a year
Obetz
Can I pay a 5 for someone to get me from obeys?
Can I come?
I hate LA
He's not accomplishing anything by going to the club that already wins the cup every other year
What if the crew got him
They get every player
I hate LA
I just looked 
Wear drogba, their gear in the uc store isn't great
Tomorrow is an orange out guys!
So stupid
Why didn't higuain just let him take the penalty
This team is going to suck
We already struggled scoring until last game
We lost all of our goals
Gregg's has to come up with a whole new system 
And produces in flashes, not consistent 
The guy doesn't run
Honestly would of been happier trading higuain if I had to choose
We put him in every ad campaign around the city, this team is supposed to be the best in the league
To get who? Nobody good overseas wants to come to Columbus
He just signed a new contract
I'm a little outraged by it
They could have recovered, and you can't take away Montreal 
Well especially not now
He was our best player
How come they couldn't wait a little longer?
I mean ibra can have a bad attitude but you don't give a talent like that away in just one week
We just lost 20+ goals with no one to replace him 
Sounds good 
Ok I have 4 now for me, Nick, Logan, and mccoy
I didn't know mccoy was coming I'll get one more
As early as you want
When are you guys going to get here
I bought 3 tickets for 20 bucks in the Bailey
We can get dinner
The game is at 4
Woah you can leave a couple hours after
Btw no one ever responded what's your guys' plan?
I also forgot to mention I have a race Sunday morning at 9 for you guys coming down Saturday
My place is a little cramped but if you need to crash somewhere we have a blow up bed we can put in our kitchen as long as your cool with dogs possibly jumping on you in the morning, it's up to you. If Zach is here you probably would prefer his place. I have to work Tuesday though at 2. That's why I'm saying that if you want to come early Saturday we can have the whole day to hang if you would rather not have an uncomfortable bed, it's not a really far drive. 
Is Zach going to be here? Are you guys leaving that night?
Yeah I'll get on that tomorrow, we should be able to, you also can get some online im pretty sure 
Crew game at Toronto right?
Hey I would be if it was just a day thing
Switches
We all should get a sterling jersey each time he switched teams
From Liverpool..
Brian can get his sterling too!
You looked good when I saw you
Never listened to a word she said
And the professor was horribly boring
Development of political thought, which I know sounds like a joke, but I hate philosophy so much 
I had one today that didn't go well at all though
Such a relief
Just finished today
Is everyone done with school?
Yeah that's a good place to go to research that
Wow, that's really cool
Why are you going there?
China?
But I hope they would come down earlier than that if you want hang with us
At
It's a Nippert on the 14th
Zach you'll be in town right?
They play at 4 against Pittsburgh that day
Oh yeah we can watch the FC cincinnati game too
Woo hooo
😑 just say the 14 th is a priority 
We can just hang out, catch up, I'll show you around and what not
Yeah I set the date out like a month ago for you guys
Me too
Are you guys still coming down the 14th?
That was a good tournament
I'm so happy you remember
Hahaha
Noooo
Me and Logan used to get hyped to their songs
They have a few classics
Boyz
I would have voted new boys
Ah I was just wondering, but ok guys deans list we're all in
Come on we all have it in us
Also has anyone here been to Williamsburg, Virginia?
Can we all make a pact that we're going to get 4.0s this semester?
You do multiple complicated science wise things that I won't be able to understand 
Which I can't do
Yeah, but it's either this major or I do math
Only 1 final
I have almost all 10 to 15 page papers, all due tomorrow
I did a paper from 11:30 to 7 in the morning: fun fact
Is anyone else extremely stressed from finals??
You bring out the best in me BRIAN 
GO CITY
Well they shouldn't be anymore
And atleti just beat them
Most people would pick Barca over city though
How do they not have good talent
Atletico made the final 2 years ago
No
They're just scrappy big guys with a quality striker
Their style is a way you would hate to play
Why
Talking about UCL
Then
So who do you root for the 
All the other teams have
They have never made the semis
They're the underdogs!
I hope Man City wins it
Helps out my public speaking skills
It's grown on me
By the way I got elected vice-president
I have a MUN conference
No I'm going to be in Williamsburg, Virginia 
That's impressive
Yeah I saw that
No I didn't see how many I was working and it was cold and rainy but they won
Exactly
I would absolutely suck at golfing but I've always wanted to try
I think all of us are capable 
Losers
I am
Are you doing it Craig?
Are you ready to run the Columbus marathon in October
Why are you making that face
Haha don't worry you did a good job already
I'll start up this weekend
Oh I definitely am
First season was great
Because I got 20 minutes into the first episode and I wasn't liking what was happening
Really?
Haven't seen second season though
Already do
I'm in but are you possibly ok with me not giving you the money until you come here may 14th?
Need 2 now
There it goes
This is more painful to watch than our World Cup Belgium game
Our U23s are dreadful
He was a yard on
He got robbed 
Horrible call
Noooooo
Logan and mccoy are you rooting for Colombia?
Pulisic did really well for being 17
Bacca just had the nicest turn and finish
Alright just trying to make sure you're not feeling screwed
If not that's ok I just don't have the money at the present moment is the thing
If I can pay you back some time in the future will you cover me until then?
Want to be there so bad
It pains me to read this conversation ^
We're not going to qualify!!
Wtf
You know that if we tie or lose our next game we prob won't be in the World Cup
Guys
Oh I can mccoy 
Guaranteeing another win this week!
If Indiana lose im Kansas' number one fan
It's about stopping you from winning
Then Logan wins
Unless Kansas wins it all
If unc wins he wins out group pretty much
That's my only chance of beating nick in the bracket challenge
Everyone root for Indiana tonight
That's a good looking man
So there's a chance
Wait I have Oklahoma winning
Me
I'm glad someone does
Forgot about mila
So back off
I appreciated her in elf
She always has
1. Zoey deschanel
2. Reese Witherspoon 
3. Emma Stone
4. Emma Watson
5. Rihanna
What are yours?
Yeah or else it would be top 1 for me 
Reason for asking is I don't really count models as celebrities
Celebrity?
Hey what the heck I earned that 8th spot!
Pretty much never for me 
Also, he is a usa player!!
Sucks
Heard about the game
Sorry I've been out in no service land
Oh gosh..
You're going to lose the next game probably, needed overtime to beat a Mac team
"The silencer"
Really? Because Ohio state lost to Connecticut by 20+ points and we beat them twice this year
Unlike some other schools
Michigan at least made the tournament..
Me too Zach!!
We're going to be tied for 1st place tonight 
Logan you didn't pick gonzaga
😂
Mccoy BRIAN Craig you guys too if you want
Free it up!!
Nooooo
Logan free up the 14th!
May 14th?
That's what I meant
You got to go to every game?
But other than that 
I have MUN 13-17 of April so that weekend can't work unfortunately 
I know we need to though
When are you going to come down? Oh wait..
You're the crew sc
Sorry
I know
Only last year counts
Just one
😄
That buffalo was is you though
I haven't seen that yet
Have you seen the 30 for 30 four falls of buffalo?
Shut up nick
And little rock, what the heck
But still that's a good call with the yale pick
I picked Wichita so that will get me 10 back
Logan you have every pick right
Thanks, I'm in
What's your bracket group?
Nick!
2-0 Juventus by the way
Sorry man
Just got word that they have already have their whole schedule booked for the spring nick
Joachim Lowe should go to Arsenal after the Euros
What about simeone?
Do you want him out?
Is Wenger gone if they get knocked out?
Pks
Win in pjs
Arsenal is going to pull it off
Who else is thinking that Arsenal are advancing the CL quarters?
Just two players left, and so do I
You're my next victim
Be scared nick
On the bright side..
But we suck
The new kits are awesome
Someone please tell me why we just lost at home to Philadelphia
I don't either I always thought you were the one destined for beard greatness. I'm definitely letting it go for the rest of the semester.
My style is turning more hippy by the day and this beard just adds to it the more I let it go 
Beard update for everyone
That sucks..
Haha gotcha, are you free to come with Logan anytime soon?
I don't know if you would want to play us, we beat Ohio state twice in the fall
Is your club team good?
Haha well alright
For the president's number 
No not for the spring, I can get you contact info though if you need it
A Barkley Suns one would be cool too
Is he a thunder fan now?
I had an AI one back in the day
A ray Allen supersonics one would be cool
Yes I want the tmac one!
I've been wanting that for so long
Which one is better for you
Oh shoot, well can you come down on a weekend day still?
Not holding back
Also, BRIAN, you'll be facing the maximum amount of my fantasy skills on full display this week
For any of you coming to cincinnati during spring break he has a concert the 25th which is why I was asking, not a fan but my brother wants to go. 
Haha no but I need to know if you guys like him!
I don't know what that means
Also, does anyone here like Fetty Wap?
What the heck
Yeah, 5 years ago..
Throwback
I guarantee victory over BRIAN HOFFMAN this week!
Guess what
Ok guys!
Wondolowski and feilhaber for example
I don't pick players I don't like either, even if they're good
Can you afford all of those guys?
Almost no one is an obvious point getter in MLS, I try to have a balanced squad
When week after week they always suck
Like not picking Newcastle players, for example..
I just need to switch some ingredients to the formula
Precise and careful consideration
I pick off of my soccer knowledge expertise of course
I can easily turn it around?
It's just the 1st game right?
I am just so bad
That's the contribution I give
If they need a pick me up win, and they see that they're playing me, they start feeling good about their week
Everyone will be starving to play me each week..
Why do I suck so much
Yep
I agree
Yeah he's not a CAM, he's definitely a holding one
Instead of a Bradley though I would like a modric type of player or busquets
Really im just more sad that no other player can do as good of a job
 I wouldn't put anyone in his spot, I'm not saying he shouldn't be the focal point of our team
Why Nick?
Agreed Logan
Trapp has no moves
Maybe a little less dynamic actually
Wil Trapp has potential to be a Michael Bradley
I wouldn't of cared if he went to MLS five years later
Like he had potential to be a starter at Everton his whole career in defensive mid good 
Well I wouldn't go that far, he's a good defensive mid
Messi is playing in it
Wish we could go to a copa America game
Zardes plays like crap for the national team lately too
Full season at Sunderland..1 goal
Always will love Dempsey though
Their 2014 World Cup performances really killed things for me
I used to love Bradley and altidore
Toronto is a team I want to root for but that I can't 
DC, New England and red bulls are weak
First of all the eastern conference should not be hard for us to win
League definitely
LA does it 
Our weakest player is park hurst probably
Yeah not satisfied with playoffs now, not with the team we have, it's actually very solid
We pretty much kept everyone, we have a good group of young and old, honestly, if we don't win supporter's shield, this season is a disappointment
You know how angry that makes me
We lost the MLS cup at our stadium
We should be ticked
I partially think we could win like 4 or 5-0
2-1 Columbus
That's right
I'm in
Our league
For MLS
What's the code?
Thank goodness city scored
Go Tottenham!!
 😂😂😂
There were sections of the team that didn't like any other
They were somewhat dysfunctional
That's the type of player us soccer looks for
It reminded me of joe back in our pride days
http://www.theawayendfooty.com/the-home-front/2016/3/1/skill-is-decision-making-not-scissors
This has been a lifelong struggle for all of us I feel like with other teammates
Who is that
I'm winning MLS fantasy this year
I'm excited though!
I'm 85% sure you won't get shot
Just pick a day or two, we can play soccer and hang out and Zach may be around too
I'm not doing anything spring break
That would be perfect man
Yeeeeep
I want you guys to come down
Nope
I think it's the longest ever actually
Too long
Better than FIFA?
How come you guys never played that game with me
Why are you ignoring me
F you guys
Nobody explained what it is!!
What is rocket league
New England Revolution: Nick
I don't think any team has ever won CL back to back
Zlatan is having a better season than Suarez
PSG actually has a real shot I think
But like I said, they're at home..they should have more possession
They were at home..Suarez hit the post
They were doomed with that draw
I mean you couldn't of expected them to win
nielskalican@gmail
Not thankful for that
You guys also exposed me to the human centipede  for some reason
Haha I don't know why we always watched that so much 
Professor
Masters in public policy and then finding a job associated with that, poly sci professor also
Anymore
No I'm not going that route anymor
School is so long
F guys I just want to graduate 
Trump would be a great president
No
Never even heard of that club in my life
Let's just all retire to Fiji one day
At the beginning I was saying this is atrocious and then a couple minutes in I love it
And has a great soccer team 
It revolves around a college that profits off of semi-pro athletes that don't get paid 
Columbus is plateaus and no water
I don't want all 4 seasons
I'm going there in May
California has mountains and a beach
Not true
And I'm not a fan of West Virginia
Yeah that's a long drive
I hate the unpredictable weather
I want to live somewhere where there are mountains and it's warm
Vacations are not enough
There are better places than Columbus
There are so many beautiful places I want to go and live
Why do you never want to leave Columbus?
I'm for sure moving out west when I graduate
When?
Wait, what?
I'll be living in cincinnati still
Welcome to the club
Happy birthday nick!!
Thanks guys!! I'm glad I have everyone's approval I thought the blue socks were risky
So much speed
Those are tomorrow 
Well none of the games today were great match ups 
Manchester United are so bad
Grows back so quick
It's a lot
So much beard
But also he got rid of him at Barcelona..so there might be some animosity
Yeah I mean if pep feels like he can motivate him 
Go
But I'll be sad too see them both to
Zabaleta is old too
He has too much of an ego now for a coach like him
I mean it probably would of happened either way with or without pep
I can't explain that
Yeah..
That's assuming kei stays on the same level
They should win most of their games
Yeah I feel the chemistry is all there, everyone fits the system, it's all in place, those other teams are still trying to get a feel for one another
If everyone stays they should win supporters shield
No I didn't, I never was super impressed by him
We would of been in the champions league
Can't believe we lost the cup
Yeah that's probably true
I don't think they will
We're too proud of not being like Europe
Well nevermind on that
Oh, yeah that's lame
What?
Would you favor it in baseball?
Are you opposed to promotion/relegation?
Which is better?
Wait we have 3 of them?
Haha I don't even know any of the team's besides the cosmos and our team
Haha yeah man that would be awesome I'll free up that weekend!
And if that's the case then you definitely can
Might actually have a spare bedroom because we're close to moving into a house 
I'll ask lex if she minds
Who's Maggie?
Come to both!
The basic comment comes after the Real Madrid one
You want us to look like Real Madrid
Aka basic beeps
We are trail blazers for a new uniform trend!
And exactly! It's super unique!
I knew what it was but I don't look at it enough to see how it's emulated on a jersey
No you're ruining the flag part!
That's a color on the flag though 
The top being primarily blue would of been cool
This is freaking cool
You want a boring generic type 
You guys are lame I love it
That's pretty awesome!
Oh I see
You mean the stripes?
Where is the flag?
It's cold there
How does that connect with Columbus?
Maybe that was a goal to make our brand more unique
So props to them
I don't think anyone else has similar uniforms anywhere though
I like the shorts
Like they're about to all play a game on the beach
Looks like a Caribbean kit
Yeah most likely you don't even get sick from it
But everyone probably already knew that
It just damages newborn babies
Rarely requires hospital visit if you get it
To alleviate our worries even if there was an outbreak here we shouldn't necessarily be worried about our own health
At least cincinnati is farthest from Cleveland in Ohio
That means it will be all over right?
You
To all of ou
I have always said to come down 
WHAT?!
I'm just saying that it seems to be a lot harder to get Logan to commit if I don't nudge him around a little
Nick you're already coming
Nippert
They're at nippers
Home games start in April
The Logan Patino?
Wait Logan you would actually come see me?? 
You guys should all come down though for semi-pro games
There is no safe place around campus honestly
Yeah I have a lot of animals
Hey what's wrong with having 2 dogs
Me and Zach live in safer areas of off campus by the way
Goodness it's so bad here 
Bernie literally hasn't changed his position on anything besides gun control
Woman
And yes it was written by a women
She just goes with the flow, that's not a leader
Her foreign policy decisions have also been questionable though. She voted for the Iraq war, and saw how it destabilized the area, and then supported that we get rid of gaddafi in Libya, and now that's arguably ISIS' strongest controlled area in some parts of the country
I was inspired by an article I read about republicans tainting Hilary's name and progressives should be ashamed by falling into the trap they laid pretty much. What made me mad was that progressives don't dislike Hillary for reasons republicans do other than that she lies so often. It's because she is a sell out just like the rest of the Republican Party.
Thank you McCoy
Someone had already called the cops
But he robbed a place right before ours
He didn't try to rob our place, he just looked confused
When we called 911 the cops were already on their way
I just uncovered that right after I started telling you guys..
He thought our apartment was Chris' 
Aggravated robbery 
And someone named Chris got arrested for the same charge last night
When he left
He was knocking on our window asking for Chris 
This is him
I just found out something
Guys 
Police came and arrested him
It was a 6'3 black guy who was wacked out, and I had to talk him to leaving the apartment, he eventually did and then I closed and locked it real quick and he started knocking on the windows
Forgot to lock door
Guys somebody walked into me and Lexi's apartment last night while we were sleeping
That happened to my dog Murphy back in the day, it was more of in the span of a month though, and he was much younger, it's horrible luck 
That's horrible, he was a great dog, cant believe it happened that quickly like that
I'm really sorry about that guys
Oh no
It would be more like a 1.21
Nick I couldn't get a 3.21 in pharmacy 
Cvs is way overpriced
Physicist MIT money
You do once you make MIT money
I want to be college debt free
Be one
Be a surgeon
You guys save lives
Just saves a lot of money and helps in the long run for better jobs, computer science I would guess a masters isn't as vital just because it's probably a hard program to get through in a bachelor's anyway
Not as awesome as MIT
Doing the 4+1 program
I'm getting my masters in one less year
Thought he was so much better
Sissoko has let me down big time this season
Newcastle suck
What do I do..
I'm a mess
I want to write political campus articles for our newspaper but I don't want to be a journalist
Not MUN
I want to be president of the political science student association
I wouldn't mind except for the fact that none of it is real
I can't change the conferences and the structure of it
How can you be president of something you don't like
They want me to be president next year
I've been the treasurer all year
MUN= model United Nations 
I tried to be, I'm not
Guys I'm not an MUN guy
If it makes you feel better I subbed out martial for giroud today
Honestly though Tottenham look like the best team in the league
Man city and Leicester play Saturday
Arsenal 4th in the table now
I mean it was a tough angle, he made something out of nothing 
Got injured in capital one cup
He's out for the season 
First touch was insane
I wouldn't call his first one a sitter
Watford is my dad's favorite team: fun fact
Is he the greatest of all time?
What team are you going to ally with while he's there mccoy?
Messi' game heavily relies on his quickness and speed, once he loses that even more than he has, it will fall dramatically, which will happen pretty soon. Successful old PL players are have a way more significant physical presence
Have fun with that
This means it's more likely mourinho is going to go to United, McCoy
Yeah but if he doesn't have the same success it will be annoying to hear people say he's not as good as people think. He's not at the same level he was at a few years ago 
We're going to get Messi
Pep to City!!
I'm watching greys anatomy
No they're side by side pretty sure
Everything is just a little too random
But Zardes isn't a striker to me
Zardes and Altidore partnership is a nice idea
Apparently everyone thinks jones is still good
Kinda random
Interesting lineup
Twitter
Finlay is starting
Newcastle's going to get Doumbia
Those examples he has not proven he can be yet
His passing and composure have been too questionable as a def mid, gist of what I'm saying
So that's the most important thing
He's never going to be a player that goes around anyone or play with flair
He's a solid player don't get me wrong but he hasn't cleaned up his decision making 
Trapp is shaky passing out of the back 
I think tchani has good size and when he's in good form is a great center mid
I don't really see will as the next big thing, I don't get a sense that he's that talented 
He has the most potential I think
They should start tchani
You think they'll all play?
Happy birthday mccoy!!! You're 18 man so weird
Alright well that will be good though I was wondering when that would start up
You know when their season starts?
John Harkes
The coach of the team is a former USMNT captain
Yeah we can do that though
The only time you want to come down and see me is to take advantage of my UC perks, haha
What do you mean?
Our last World Cup team was much better than the team now, all of our elite players were almost all in their 30s, and now they're two years older, the whole team has crashed because of it
Yeah at this point we don't play better than an average European country
I mean his impact on the youth system really won't surface until another 4 years
Yeah but no one is going to be elite level by 2018
We're not even going to make it out of the group in Russia
I don't know I always was confused about that, our youth really are just so disappointing
Oh nevermind forgot about him put him in there to replace Yedlin and Zardes
Kind of think we shouldn't call up Altidore anymore 
We're going to struggle to qualify 
Pretty weak
Bradley, Cameron, Howard, Brooks, Yedlin or Zardes
He dipped in form badly, ac Milan didn't even want him anymore
Weird
Our best national team players are on defense 
Hopefully replaces terry
Yeah how do you get so much worse at 23-24?
I mean there are a lot of good places to do hiking that are not a far drive, we never have really done that before thought it could be fun, it's cheap also
I think a hiking/camping trip sounds fun
Is anyone open to anywhere else besides Myrtle beach?
That obviously not happening
Yeah I thought we would get falcao
Connor Casey on the Crew
She says thank you
Yeah they are
Named that crab Liam 
Two dogs, 4 birds, 4 crabs
Two trophies for MLS Cup and Open Cup
Crab tank that Lexi made me for our 4 crabs
There you go b.o.b.
Do the Wisconsin one
When is it?
Promoting myself to the tourney this year
I got relegated from my first round loss last year from it
I have been competitive in things other than fantasy
Thank you Logan, I think everyone here has been hoping for a resurrection of me being competitive again
You're only as good as your current segment
New year new Niel!
Lounging in a Starbucks right now got to pull myself together
All of this reminiscing about Julie and Logan is going to make me cry that I haven't seen you guys in so long
Classic Logan 
Told her you liked her then ignored her the next day 
Sounds just like him
The part that cracked me up the most was the the first encounters with Logan giving a blank stare with no reaction
F kolin
I thought that was you
Yeah made you sound like a real jerk
Still are, just a loyal one
Smooth 
Nice touch on asking her in spanish
Your whole story is out there
My morning read
Wait, who's Maggie?
That Liverpool game was crazy
I'll get back to you on that later today Logan
Too bad it wasn't in Cincinnati
What made you choose that place? Did you apply to a bunch of places?
Congrats man! You living out there by yourself?
Where at?
Woah, I think I was in California when he did, I didn't have service most of the time
What are you talking about?
No one tells me anything
Where are you going?
Why can't he?
I have him
Doubt it happens 
That would be kind of cool to get him though
Have we lost anyone in our starting 11?
Jmac isn't great though
Interesting, good location though
Well off of campus you know what I mean
Where at on campus?
No he's not anymore
Also sweet
I have never seen a Russian league jersey being worn by anyone
Haha you like Doumbia?
Geez that's a creative one too
That's a good one
What did everyone else get
Yeah that is amazing 
I'll buy you lunch
Their
If anybody wants to make a Cincy road trip everyone can get there jerseys I never have a car 😢
Haha hopefully he doesn't leave again
The emblem looks stitched so I believe you! Oh my goodness and you got a long sleeve I freaking love you
Thank you!!
Oh god 😍
I almost got you tim ream Fulham but too pricey 
What address do you want me to mail it to?
This is nick's
Can I know what jersey I got?
The only thing I can do is take a megabus back to Columbus but someone would have to pick me up
I'm already in Cincinnati 
I've been wanting to see you guys but I have no way to get up there anymore
Mailing them out to you guys tomorrow
What are the distances for each?
Yeah let's do it
Oh shoot I didn't see you put that
When is the triathlon nick?
Guys don't worry your jerseys will get to you!! I'll see you all very soon!
Guys I cannot make it today, just got back from California today and all of my family is here I didn't know we were doing it the 1st, early congrats to the winner hope everyone has fun 
Be back in the group message after my vaca. This has been such an awesome trip, congrats mccoy on your title, be ready to lose in the FIFA tournament everyone
What are you doing the 2-3?
Well even if everyone can't make it im hanging out with whoever is here on those days
Do it Christmas Eve because I can't even make it home until late tomorrow, will everyone be home the 1-3? We should do FIFA and gift exchange on one of those days
^^^^
No preference
What did you get in that?
I want to see that at MIT next year!
I can't but it's more fair if I miss one then you having to miss two
Agree ^^
I mean are they going to want you in there if you've been puking all morning and have constant diarrhea?
They can't fire you for one day 
Call in sick?
I can't do the night on the 23rd I got to leave in the early morning the next day so if you guys were planning to do FIFA at night I can just do the classic
That should work if it's like a 9-3 time frame
There you go Craig
I don't know
From what we were talking about yesterday, this is actually not bad from Donovan
I don't know I just tweet at them every once in a while when I see them up and they put it on the show some of the time
They should just hire me right?
Guys I've made another annual appearance
Awesome, so proud of you man
What is your major going to be?
Oh gosh that's insane, I'm sure you will prosper there though McCoy
Why? Too much pressure on the students?
Oh my goodness don't forget about me when you're a famous scientist/whatever profession you're choosing to be 
Are you going??
Congrats!!
Holy crap McCoy!!!!
That day would work a lot better for me
What about 22nd?
That's how you do it, my friends
I mean it is what it is I don't have a problem with taking the best talent of players who American citizens, I mean I would like to see everyone be homegrown but we're not the only country who does that kind of thing either
Completely agree
Whether or not they're true it's still not right
If she cares about the national team success, she wouldn't make those statements because she has to know they're going to get headlines and bring more negative attention to the team
Yeah I mean I think it's inappropriate that if you're technically still in the national team system to make those comments
Also she has a giant ego
And she's complaining about jermaine jones
Sydney leroux is Canadian
Why is she using her day of remembrance to bring down the USMNT?
Pretty ignorant 
Not happy about it
Irresponsible 
Slackers
I don't think you've lost them Logan, if Julie started pulling that and you shared it with us I would have your back just the same as I would for any one of you.
Nothing she is nick's girlfriend and I trust his judgment. I have no doubt that she is great, but it seems that she's using the dynamics of their relationship to push Nick around and belittle his feelings, while being selfish and putting hers in front of his, and I will take issue to that, because Nick is a great guy and my guess is he has been extremely selfless and she is taking advantage of that. You don't get to do that to my friends.
It really makes me upset hearing the whole situation and how much she has kept you out of the loop. From what I have caught every time you try to be strong and call her out on her wrongdoings, she takes the conversation to conflicts she's having with distance and tries to talk about those problems, without addressing the obvious fact that what she is doing is wrong. When she does that you need to remember that it doesn't make it ok for her to be screwing around behind your back, and she's only complaining about distance to avoid/pretend like she's not doing anything wrong. Nick you're a smart guy, do not play dumb, do not fall prey to that crap, your feelings need to be respected and if she does not respect them then you should know what you need to do.
Nick that's pretty naive just because they're only working out together doesn't mean that something can't happen because of that. Do you seriously think that guy gives an f about you and Baylee's relationship? That he doesn't have his own agenda to get back with her? Because I don't even know him but I can guarantee that he does. He's a college student hanging with his ex. Your girlfriend may have good intentions, but he does not, and if you give him this kind of opportunity to see her every day week to week he's going to start taking more chances you need to draw a line and not be comfortable with it, that's just my take. But you know more than me so whatever you decide I support you.
Working out together seems too much of an physical, somewhat can be intimate thing for me to be comfortable with, they don't need to work out together. The whole thing is bs nick, if I were you I would be pretty mad.
It's an awesome environment here I love it
I just got pushed for clapping when nugent missed the field goal
Go steelers!
Took like a week
I got mine a few days ago
I actually like Facebook again
Logan and McCoy if you guys want to treat yourselves these are on a huge sale
how long will you be in town?
Haha I'm here for all of you guys, I'm really sorry nick being in your position is super difficult
Should not be ok*
Nick you said earlier that you she told you she still loves him, clearly she is not completely over him, so in my mind I think your choice is pretty clear. It's good to have trust in her and everything, but the only person you have the right to not being ok, and should be ok with her hanging out with, is her ex. You do not want to play this game man, unless there is a huge turnaround and she apologizes and stops hanging out with him, and clearly she is not going to do that. As a friend, I strongly recommend you break up, I know it hurts, but you'll be better off in the long run.
I don't like that she's hanging out with him, she shouldn't be doing that and going out to eat with her ex, that is never a good thing. She knew about the distance when she got into the relationship, and she shouldn't be the one contemplating breaking up with you, it should be you strongly considering breaking up with her, she is the one who messed up, don't let her toy with you man, if she is not serious about turning it around then end it now 
Well that's pretty messed up man, I'm sorry that she did that to you there are no excuses especially since they broke up a while ago. If she's saying things like she still loves him I would not want to continue on with the relationship
I'm really sorry nick, how long ago did they break up? Did you know about him before you guys started going out?
I'm fully aware that I am a huge underdog going into the game with Logan
Haha I actually used to but we have the table blocking it a lot of the time and my dogs are pretty good defenders and will do anything they can to keep me from scoring
Not enough
When I got this he had just signed a contract extension
Sorry sterling moved
The one I got this year is sexier 
There's
Theirs yours BRIAN
I have the jersey
Is he leaving?
1. Yes
2. Sometimes send a quick text, mostly to change songs.
3. I do get worried, but I'm probably just naive about my driving abilities that make me comfortable enough to multi-task
@Logan Patiño 
Yeah I am off until the 11th so ill have time
New Year's Day
So even that won't work
5:55am flight
However, unless we can make exceptions about the soccer classic being a day early this year, (which I know we probably can't, tradition is important) I will not be able to make that since I'm leaving Christmas Eve morning. 
I'm telling you that's not going to happen and I'm coming to visit at least for two days
Haha I'll be able to hang out a couple days leading up to Christmas
This week is my last week
LA lakers? 00-02? Bulls 91-93 96-98
La Galaxy dynasty 
Seahawks 14-15
We got to keep everyone, then we could win it
Goodness nick, you can't hang out at all that week?
Until next semester
As in ill be done then
I'm done with work here probably until the 17th
I'm going to San Francisco 25-1
I say the week leading up to Christmas
Yeah when are we all getting together?
It was at the beginning of it
On the bright side I saw you guys on tv twice
I think tchani has gotten so much better though, 
Yeah he was too much of a non factor, it was not clicking up front
And that was atrocious by our fans, I love Columbus but the trashiness part of the city couldn't of showed more
They outplayed us I think, not enough hunger when we got the ball in the final third, just a bunch of crossing with hope that it would end up in the right spot
Yeah at the same time they should of had a penalty for handball and they smacked the post 3 times
So how is everyone doing?
That national anthem though
That's like as much as a Ticke
Like being there live to witness another team celebrating on our home field hoisting the MLS cup trophy
I'm just saying won't it be horrible?
Guys what if we lose?
Yeah pretty horrible news
Questionable for tomorro
Kei Kamara injured in training today
Didn't Brooke score on you when I was a senior?
ME
But who's going to take home the FIFA and soccer classic trophies..
Woah Logan you get 15 seconds of top of the table and you think you're Donald trump 
3rd person, really Craig?
Probably not
Sorry guys probably im tied down for money at the moment I really wish I could though
Haha yeah just the smart thing to do, I'm confident we'll win though
A little risky because if we lose it's associated with a bad memory
When I go there that's what they sell the normal ones for
35 is my guess
Yeah I have the sterling one right here
For those of you hoping you didn't get me as the guy giving you their jersey I ordered mine yesterday
It sounds like it but it's not like it because we talk about nothing that I really care much for
You have to make speeches about dumb topics in front of people you don't really like or know and it's not fun at all
I do not recommend it, sucks so much
Have any of you ever taken a speech class?
Hopefully they can keep the same team for next year
They should of put a goal away
They are either on it or they're not
This team is so confusing to me
Not sure if I'm happy about the sub, inexperienced player
Findlay tried to snake and failed miserably
I don't see us completely collapsing this half
Our team is really good
That control volleyed shot from Kamara was so nice
One more half and we're moving on!
Well Findlay blew it
1-0 crew
I'm reading actually there only chance is an Alabama loss to Florida in SEC title game
And if Alabama loses then they're definitely in
I guess North Carolina can make a case but osu will probably beat them out if they beat Clemson
If one of those teams lose they're next in line
Need Alabama or Clemson to lose and osu might sneak in
I've been struggling because I have two Newcastle players, and I haven't come to terms with the fact they're awful
Hey the games aren't over yet!
Where at?
How do you guys find those that you send?
You guys are no match for my ping pong skills
Me too!
Against Guatemala
Just announced it today
It's at crew stadium
Anyone want to go to the WCQ in March?
Not in the starting lineup
Just smart signings
I mean we don't have a ton of homegrowns
I think big teams will still buy expensive players 
Most championships
La biggest counter to it
I don't know if it will change the trend..
Don't we have one of the lowest budgets too?
That's awesome, I did not think we would do as well as we're doing
What happens to your ticket if Columbus doesn't host?
That'd odd that it's not in a neutral location
Wait it can't be in Columbus
And what's the date? And how much were they?
Where is it at?
Guys how is it?!
3-1 us
Score predictions!
I want to but I am in cincinnati without any transportation like always
Miss you guys
They didn't even have their QB playing
And they still let almost 200 yards of rushing
The offensive line got dominated though
At the same time, our offensive and defensive line truly got outplayed the entire game, so I don't know if it would of mattered, that's really why we lost
I mean if you are going to be predictable wouldn't you rather have zeke running than Barrett?
3rd quarter, wind at our backs, virtually no passing
Therefore, you have to throw the ball
But I mean I don't know what the offensive coordinator is doing, absolutely no adjustment in second half to play calling, they knew we were going to run every single play
You have Thomas, Marshall, and Braxton and you barely threw the ball
Good job to Michigan state, but lack of passing is what cost us
No playoff if we lose
Yep
This is it 
Anybody going to say anything? Any thoughts?
All comes down to if we can get a block, if not 17-14 Michigan state
Pretty dumb they're not
I would call timeout if I were Ohio state
They have the wind at their backs
They're going to kick a field goal to win it
Oh geeez
23 straight
This could be it
Big 3rd down
Anyone nervous?
Better runner than Barrett
Should just put Braxton at QB
I mean they can try to switch it up a little more
I'm rooting for them!
Besides that td pass
Supposed to have the most explosive offense, and have the most predictable play calling
Ohio State is getting pretty fortunate today
I'm happy you got your revenge though Logan, I was such an arrogant  kid 
That's pretty accurate in the present day 
😂😂true I suck, completely forgot you beat me
If that was me defending you it would of got swatted!!
Yep, people are willing to let thousands of people die because of their religious and racist insecurities, really puts some irony into our nation being "the home of the brave"
Basically sums up what I was saying why Ohio technically isn't allowed to turn them down
Nick give me a few days
Technically not allowed to refuse them
Argentina Brazil game much better
I don't know they might be pretty limited we'll see
December 12
I'm technologically incapable of that
I'm struggling to pick, guys help
Don't know, but do we watch the USA game or Argentina vs Brazil, both on at the same time??
I know I know, I'm going to try my best
I've missed too many this semester, start getting credit taking off if I miss again
I need to see if my parents can drive me back
It's on a Sunday night and I have classes the next day :(
Watch his highlights from this year and you'll see my point
By the way, Neymar in my mind has surpassed Messi and Ronaldo for best player in the world
I'm glad you guys like it but that picture was taken a month ago and I still haven't shaved so you may feel differently now 😁
Problem is I have to find out how I'm getting there and back from cincy
I'm going to look at the prices but maybe
Oh dang I was going to buy it
Week?
Is it next weeks
What about me....
Did we score?
Nor
My heart and spirit will be at the not
I started listening to Christmas music two weeks ago
I mean it's ridiculous though, no it will never change but I cannot ignore the stupidity of our education system that we revolve our college institutions around athletics. Being a fan and going to a game is fun but other than that what does it really do for you? Isn't that what pro sports are for? We're going to screw millions of college students over so that we can keep building on another platform of sport fandom where the ncaa, coaches and sportscasters get rich off of and we get poorer? It's insanely stupid.
And yeah brian it's becoming conflicting for me to know all of that and still be a fan of college sports
Don't have new emojis
Check
To Julie?
Exactly I am Swedish, we're so close to qualifying for EURO 2016
What's your number?
Logan answer me!!
Is that really it?
-__-
Logan Caleb Crumley wants to contact you what number should I give him? Is your phone still the 578 number?
But if everyone else is on board
Brian you'll get two this year 
Fabian scores against Juventus!
It's where our MUN conference is at
I'll be at duke
No but 1-1 would of been so much better
Congrats Craig, hope you feel good
Must of taught him that last year
Drogba pulling a costa move
I knew something was going to happen!
You're like 45 sec ahead
Nick you ruin it
What happened
We looked good for a sec
Honestly they give us the headsets right now no training we would be more entertaining
We all should be commentators
Brad was a crew player he's cool
Well those majors should know those jobs are unrealistic for them
Most monotone voice ever
Why is Donovan a broadcaster
Boooo Craig!
2-0 crew!
Afful is by far!
2-0 crew!
Could Howard of saved it?
Offer them enough money you'd be surprised 
Dunga
Durga
They should get ferguson out of retirement 
Rodgers
Yeah, honestly it's a good idea if you want to grow MLS you get more high profile coaches
People would want to play for him, and they can afford high profile players
If mourinho coached the galaxy they would win supporters shield every year I think 
Depends what franchise they get
I said drogba would!!
My analysis of players are on point
Oh my goodness thank you for saving that!!
I saw the Galaxy lost I was happy
Good job Logan!!
I accidentally deleted this and didn't realize and I'm so behind!
Guys I've missed everything!!
I wanted nick to go back at me but he's not being any fun :(
I don't know where I'm going with this
The Netherlands of world cups
I recognize nick is very good 
Soccer golf, FIFA tournaments
Think of all the other competitions you let slip away
There are no supporters shields in fantasy 
*chicago fire
Good job on your us open cup win
Yeah being the New England Revolution of fantasy is pretty solid
Can't decide which is worse..
But not having a lead and choking at the end of the season..
I have a history of consistently being horrible at fantasy
Hey I don't make excuses so neither should you
Yet you're bottom of the premier table....
I'm just saying you don't get trophies for not being able to win when it counts
Are you in the MLS final though..
I'm glad I kept faith in Kane
Martial
All they have is marial
United need a proven goalscorer
They're just holding on for the most part
It's hurting city though
Not sure
Injured
It was huge for them to beat Bayern though
Nick how excited are you about arsenal right now?
Derby day and decision day!! Let's go City and Crew!
Serious of course
I'm thinking I got a good shot at the EPL one
I put in a solid season
If we win we get a bye in the playoffs
I don't why I waited so long to get the app
Mccoy you have a girlfriend?
Not mine
-__-
Someone has to be Rafi
That means nick or BRIAN is taco
Who's Ruxin?
Kevin and taco
Nah mccoy to me is Kevin, I think
You
But I'm going to be more rich and successful than all of you so suck on that
I'll start wearing fedoras when we all hang out
Yeah you guys have a point..
Wait am I Andre?
Get him mccoy
I DID
Thought this would be good since we all go to Ohio schools
Best schools in Ohio ranking

Millionaires and billionaires
Brian you seem to be half and half, Zach too kinda
Will Bernie win though?
Exactly, still raised 26 million that says a lot
Nice! I hope he wins but it's still very much a long shot
I didn't but I imagine mine would be with Bernie, through I like o malley too. Who did you get?
Yeah I liked that everyone was civil and that they talked about important issues even though they still gave broad plans on what they would do. Listening to the Republican ones are horrifying
Bernie did well but Hillary will still be up in the polls I think
Neither because they don't update anything except for rosters on old gen, same game
My PS3 won't load my stream
Are you streaming it?
Not enough to come out in the last 10 minutes
I take klinsmann's I guess because he should of just sucked it up for 10 more minutes. Subs really have an impact on how you're managing a game and who knows maybe mexico doesn't score a third if he doesn't ask for a sub
4 goals
RT
We beat Miami, FL!!
Yeah, bad day for US Soccer
He is promising but still makes too many errors passing out of the back that almost cost the Crew
No I think you're mistaking Bradley playing attacking mid is out of position. He's not good in the attack I honestly don't want him much involved in the final third because his quality drops to below mediocre in the box for me. He needs to be the guy that plays a good pass out of the back that allows us to keep possession, love beckerman but he does not do well with the ball at his feet and making decisive passes out of the back.
If I was klinsmann that's what I would do, just play mourinho minded get results football.
We have good defenders I think in besler, Cameron, and Johnson. I think they just need to make Bradley a defensive mid and let young players like Yedlin, Zardes, and wood develop attacking wise I can't stand seeing jozy underperform any longer just play the guys who look like they have potential and try to win 1-0 games until talents like gyau, Greene, Yedlin ect mature.
The whole thing about making promises in 2011 is a little tired out I don't think he expected his young talent to be so poor 4 years down the road and that he would still have to play Beasley. He made promises because he wanted to excite the fans about him taking over.
Both, we just need to accept the art of defending and counter attacking well until we ever get a personnel that can play at the highest levels of europe
I don't know, I'm a little skeptical of how Klinsmann wants us to play, haven't seen a dominating performance ever from them really under his tenure, I don't know
Yeah we don't look like we have very much quality, depressing to watch us play these days against anyone elite
Feel like I'm watching us play Belgium again
You guys suck, talk to me
Too many give aways in possession, other than that, we definitely can win
I liked how we played actually
Goodness jozy
Goodness Bradley
You texted that and it happened 10 seconds later
Nice you spoiled that for me
Exactly most of our wins our from us getting scored on first recently
I think this might help us try to dictate the game a little better let's see what happens
They are just way more comfortable
Like I said it's pretty much the equivalent, so much at stake
I was only off with beckerman being in instead of Yedlin
which one? 2010 they for sure were. 2014 they were all pretty past it, Donovan wasn't even on the squad and he was the best player of 2010
And jermaine jones
Those players in their prime by the way
I would argue bob had way better talent for that game in 2011 than klinsmann has today. Dempsey, Bradley, and Donovan along with more proven defenders, Howard was younger, and I don't think bob should of been fired.
The problem is he has to pick players who are past their prime because our young players have not proven themselves at all, it's disappointing
I think if we get blown out he should go, if we are competitive he should stay, he shouldn't be fired for simply having a worse team
It's on fox sports if you have that
Atdhe.net on Google
Yeah for some reason Dempsey hasn't played well in that little pocket he's a good 2nd striker, I'm so nervous too by the way we better win
Scratch that, Geoff Cameron instead of brooks
Dempsey Altidore up top, jones Bradley Yedlin and Zardes midfield, brooks and besler cbs, outside backs Johnson and Beasley is who I would pick. Then Howard
Yeah, honestly this is almost equivalent to a World Cup game for me, if we lose it will be really bad
If it wasn't such a massive game I would start Guzan but Howard is a big game performer and he took a year off after being with the team for a decade so he should be forgiven. Zardes and Yedlin should start on wings and need to have big games
Yeah I mean it's a one game that you need all your best players playing in and he's playing great for Everton and obviously is a big game performer. Guzan is good but he's a step down from Howard, no doubt
I would definitely start Howard by the way
I'm getting everyone's texts I think, what's it called?
That's what Klinsmann has said all along
Guzan needs to have a great game
They have a lot more quality than we do :/
My apartment
2-2 US win on penalties
You guys will win
Score predictions?!
Are you guys looking forward to the game tonight?
u r my savior
Nick, I use Python for my coding classes!
yeah lmao my supervisor sent me some tutorials for React and he was like "the first one's stupidly easy." but to do the tutorial you need working knowledge of js and XML/HTML rip me
and React uses JSX, which means I have to use XML
which means I have to learn JavaScript
well before I can even work on the project I have to learn React
@Logan Patiño have I told you about what I have to do for my UROP
there's a sign on one of the pillars in MIT's main lobby asking people what their favorite strain of marijuana is and a marker for them to record it on there with
it's lit in Boston
if u mean that come to Boston rn
I'm a
I'm no fairy princess
:(
lit
so you're moving after she comes up?
Logan what unit is it kire and I wanna creep
yeah thanks for the heads up bro
YOU'RE LITERALLY ON THE SAME STREET AS MY SCHOOL
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
who do u know at Google to get hooked up with that
???
looks like 15 GB, which should be plenty for backing things up
Drive is good for backing things up as well, I'm not sure how many GB of free storage you get tho
if it's just the email account I could actually just make some mailing lists and give you guys the addresses so you could get the storage space
I'm not sure if you have to have MIT certificates or if you just need an @mit.edu address but you can get 18,000 terabytes of storage on Dropbox for free
Dropbox
lmao rip in pieces
@Nick Casto I'm chipping away at your lead in prem fantasy 👀
hot
And considering I've never been paid to work before (though I did get a paid research position recently), it's def not bad at all
I get a $6000 stipend but have to pay about $2500 for a mandatory meal plan and housing at Caltech
truuuu
I couldn't turn it down
it doesn't pay very much at all but it's JPL so like
10 weeks!
you're right, I'm so sorry
I just accepted the offer yesterday 😄
I'll be in Pasadena, CA
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory!
my internship starts on the 20th :/
send me pics of your shenanigans
rip
@Nick Casto when is the Myrtle Beach trip planned for?
Talk to me when you win a three-peat
jk Nikki's ridiculous and idk how Christian Guzman broke up with her

@Logan Patiño I AM DECEASED
political and coding memes
@Logan Patiño 
It is! 6.042 memes boi
MIT's meme group on Facebook is absolutely hilarious
it's impossible to be interested in March madness if you don't have a team to root for
I'm so pissed I didn't turn in my bracket on time
It's Bao
WAIT SHE DOES I FORGOT
Hm, maybe they decided to be less traditional
Are both her parents Vietnamese?
No idea lol Julie asked how she chose Kire and she said "Kire chose me"
TRIANGLE
nah she doesn't have a middle name lol
her legal name is Tran but she goes by that
Kire is my gf
I watched Iron Chef America with Kire lmao St. Patty's was lit
THE CARAVAN!!!!!
Do it
I just need someone to join me in MA, it's lonely without you all
but Tufts probably has a good program and they're like 15 minutes away
unfortunately I don't think we do unless you want to switch to bio engineering
Craig come to tMIT
lol I never go on Reddit so I didn't know about that bot but I appreciate its existence
like, a lot

Logan did u do this
yo blart
I like the idea, I'm a fan of tattoos and immortalizing Ohio in any way
I'm v confused
@Craig Casto At NASA I would probably work with coding for flight systems and Microsoft would actually be next summer and it would be a project development program at their campus outside Seattle
And I'll hopefully be back for at least a little bit this summer!
I love you Nick, thank you for making me sound more impressive than I actually am
....and now I'm considering course 16 very seriously (Aero/Astro)
sorry for the late responses, I was talking to someone/eating Chipotle lol but yeah, I think having her as a contact will really help me with finding something at NASA
It was so awesome!! We basically talked the whole time about what I enjoy doing and what I want to work with and how I like a little bit of everything and that's why picking a major is hard and she was saying that I think like a systems engineer and how great that is for work at JPL
Got Microsoft at 3:30 boiiiii but I'm honestly just completely in love with NASA
Just finished my interview with NASA JPL, guys!!!!! It went so well too!!!!!!
danke Logan
whoops lol that is important
471 Memorial Drive, room 6-301
actually that's not true it's fun in a masochistic way
I think I've written 1,000 lines of code for this project and written more complex logic statements than I ever care to write again
Thank goodness it's almost Java but still
C++ (teensy 3.2)
i want to die
and this robot I made
guys look at this hat I made
Lol I would prefer to only do prem because in all honestly I hardly pay attention to MLS for longer than a few weeks aside from the Crew
@Niel Skalican EXPLAIN.
fly me out to it and I will so be there for a party
MEET MORE PEOPLE (ESPECIALLY CUTE WOMEN)
WORK YOUR HARDEST

I haven't gotten any bday poon but I did get this body pillow
Muchas gracias 😄
*oui
i would die for you nick
who's Earl Grey
the worst was her exchange with Tim Kaine, she was dodging every question
I am so concerned
February 3rd is going to literally kill me
I may or may not be going but it's looking sort of unlikely and I unfortunately won't know for a while
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It gets sooooo bad
If I played that game alone at night I would literally die
We'll see in hopefully about a month if I'll be able to 😄
I'M DYING RN
AND MICROSOFT????
NASA'S JET PROPULSION LABORATORY WANTS TO INTERVIEW ME FOR A POSITION
I'M ACTUALLY IN ACTUAL TEARS RN
GUYS
I completely forgot you're at the beach and I was incredibly confused as to how someone was skimboarding in Ada in January
Yeah, and I had one hour to do it with no outside resources other than Oracle documentation
Yeah, I'm much less stressed by this one than by Two Sigma's even though Twitter's is going to be more difficult
let's hope mine aren't too technical lol but I'll probably have to watch some OCW as well
rip
How many questions tho
How long was yours?
Yep! Or, as the email put it, 10,080 minutes lol
@Logan Patiño guess who got invited to take a coding challenge for Twitter
Toronto was like 8 or 9 I think
Being uncomfortable is natural, but letting her know that you're overcoming that discomfort to trust her will mean a lot to her and be a lot healthier for the relationship
My two cents are to trust her. I think she didn't initially tell you because she didn't want to make you worried and she probably didn't react strongly when you said something because she doesn't feel anything for the guy, like you said before. You opposing the arrangement would imply not trusting her with someone who she's explicitly shown no interest in, which is not good
I hate you so much
It's JJ style!!
You're Yuri and I'm Victor
I'm so proud :'-)
lmao send a note that says "i am in great debt. help me pls"
you have to know her yourself though
hmmm... tru
can't set a precedent of giving money away too freely
the principle tho
???????????
that was ridiculous-diculous
did you guys see Giroud's goal today???
@Craig Casto 



















smh
yeeeee booooiiiiiiiiiiii
@Niel Skalican when are you going to be available?
January 7
huh. all of our finals are three hours
How long are your finals usually?
Yeah, I assume she's trying to put the pussy on the chain wax
idk, some people say it. But it looks like a drunk text to me
lol she must be drunk or something
you guys are doing that thing you always do lmao arguing just to argue
I hate you
Logan... are you sitting on the toilet in your avi
I'm with Logan
Texas toast is just thick-sliced toast lmao
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

You'll be living around Boston regardless though, right?
Interesting
Will it maybe be at the office that's like 30 minutes from Boston? I went to an IBM employer info session and a person there worked at that office
@Logan Patiño look where I walked past today
Craig I support you and think you're every bit as funny as your brother
mercilessly succing
if you're not on the Yuri On Ice train you're the loser, pal
this place is mercilessly sucking away my will to live but it looks wonderful <3
I might be able to, might not - I applied to a summer internship program in Israel and am probably going to apply to an international research program
There were two options there
Whenever works for you guys works for me
Holy shit
I get back on the 20th!
I know I do
Everyone here appreciates a good random jersey, right?
come to Boston
Well, Craig, have I got some news for you
Wondolowski
Chris
I mean, the guy brought Chris Wondolowski to a world cup
!!!!!!
come to Boston for this hangout night so I know it's real
lit
what
It is a matter of correlation vs. causation though, because undereducated whites tend to live in rural areas that lean Republican, often regardless of race or gender. So as for whether one thing causes the other or vice-versa, that's up for debate
Statistically, gender definitely was a factor but definitely not the only one. News outlets are just pointing out the fact that every demographic except whites, especially undereducated white males, voted in favor of Clinton

I'm literally so pissed at you

This one imitates waves, so when you touch the board waves radiate outward and actually interact with other passing waves and walls constructively or destructively https://v.groupme.com/17077713/2016-10-14T15:03:35Z/2386bd98.640x360r270.mp4

Thank you for the sympathy guys, but I'd like to emphasize that I am handling it very well and actually agree that it will be good in the long run despite sucking rn

We're obeying the November Rule, which states that you shouldn't be in a relationship at MIT before November so you can get used to the academic rigor without distractions. I'm not too happy about it but it is a good idea tbh

The candidate finding process is going well
Yeah, they're in the basement
Still something you can put on a resume! Any projects like that are 👌
Would you be able to before you graduate?
the goal is to co-author a paper by the end of this year if at all possible
I'll be applying for a position probably around the end of the semester so I'll be checking out different research I might want to get involved in
also I'm taking a salsa dancing class for the first half of the semester lol
rip
Pretty awesome! Pre-orientation/Orientation week has been v lit and we schedule classes tomorrow. Also I got into a Media Lab program, which means that I'll have card access and be doing research there this year. Hopefully I can get into the synthetic neurobiology lab they have bc it's 🔥
still a position
I used my wildcard and I'm happy with my team but this week is sucking

Unfortunately Nick left and Logan is leaving
Is Craig home yet?
I love being disappointed

The good news about research into things like biological weaponry is that it isn't being studied so that it can become reality, it's being studied to learn more about how to prevent such things from killing all of us

"United States" is technically plural
I was confused because it came completely against the run of play
👍👍👍👍👍👍
I don't care about winning, I care about beating Nick
I have neither
I was waiting for someone to mention her lol
@Brian Hoffman idk, JLaw's just kinda been putting me off as of late
Omg I didn't know Lacey Chabert's the girl from Mean Girls
I know Logan loves Zooey too lol interesting how we're all into her
1. Daisy Ridley
2. Zooey Deschanel
3. Natalie Portman
4. Anna Kendrick
5. Chloë Grace Moretz
To be fair, the tickets are pricy and they're playing Guatemala
We're going

How far did you have them going?
I'll watch this time babe

California's got 457 delegates up for grabs and most northern states still are yet to vote
There's still a chance

I want to watch that movie tbh
Craig, if Watson's chef capabilities are open source, we could maybe make that app idea come true and it would be a great idea
Brian I use a website blocking extension on my laptop for that reason, I'd imagine they have them for phones too

nope

Brian are you drunk and/or high
I kept looking for a picture
Was the compliment, "Nice, I love pace whores too!"?
I mean, you're not wrong
Those stats are compelling. Arsenal definitely should have come out with a win, they dominated every facet
Okay that's fine then
huh
Are you technically in Lancaster and not Carroll?
I have a 614 area code
Oh my goodness shut up
Yes lol where else would I be?
me
mccoypatino@gmail.com
You bet it is
And Logan won't be there to enjoy it lmao
Looks like it. This will be interesting
Was that done because we're the host or what?
I wouldn't say easy
Costa Rica is very solid and Paraguay's no pushover
So the USA is playing against this
what is this guy and why is he the only thing in the "daddy" tag
yes

It's all a ploy for the government to gain more control over our lives

Do we though
Or a lot gay
She said she's not really into sports at all but she has an uncle who's an Arsenal fan and a cousin who's a Villa fan. And she loves Hamburg just because they're in Hamburg lol
She's from England actually
I have not asked her but she lived in Hamburg for a bit so probably Hamburg

Free labor for the Crew and higher volume of good ideas. Sounds like a win win to me
I think the flag idea is great but that it could have been done better. That being said, I do like the inclusion of all the colors even though they clash
I thought it was a gradient in the first picture and that's what I primarily didn't like
I really like it there actually
I know it's gonna get a lot of crap tho
The kit's already growing on me actually
They definitely did that well
Our flag unfortunately is a mess so this would follow
And yeah, we'll probably grow to like it
I think that would be cool
No wonder Kei wants to leave
That's the spirit
Finally
We're all gonna die

Bernie was part of the minority that opposed the Iraq war
I think Hilary's superior foreign affairs experience is something to consider but I just can't trust her like I can Sanders. She's told so many lies and half truths while changing her positions under the influence of others on so many occasions that I don't trust her to make decisions that would go against big corporations in any way
😘
Yep. Hence, why Hillary and Goldman-Sachs are so buddy buddy
The rest of them all are
Basically she's a sellout is the message
It's a video about how she's been influenced by corporations regarding policy making
Niel, seeing you slam Hillary on Facebook is incredible
I think he's lashing out because his name is so alliterative
jfc
Well, this is a good reminder of why locks are great
That's terrifying
Clean up your act
Larry what the hell
Oh wow
what
He was truly bizarre and irreplaceably so. I made a bagel this morning and missed hearing him run across the house at the sound of a bag of bread opening
Guide sleighs in the afterlife, old friend. Love you <3
But now Xander can again harass Buddy like in the good old days, so I'm sure he's happier now
Yeah, the vet who saw Xander had a dog pass away from the same thing as well. Since Xander was pretty old there wasn't really much we could do to stop it
I'm sort of glad that it was so quick because that way he didn't have to fight it for long
I don't know, they didn't really have a diagnosis. It was causing the most damage in his kidneys though
He was perfectly fine until Sunday and he was gone by Wednesday
We got medication for him but his heart probably gave out
He just got really sick out of nowhere. His immune system started killing off his red blood cells and he became extremely anemic and lethargic

Only nerds get Master's degrees

He's completely right

That Cosmos jersey is amazing

It was shipped a few days back so we'll see
I do not believe I did
Mine hasn't arrived even though I ordered it before Logan

I was gonna say Nesquik but actually Trumoo

Fun fact about MIT: there's no GPA freshman year
Lol I had to come clean
Not sure yet but I should have gotten like an 85-ish. Unfortunately there's no curve so it'll be a B
By the way, that 4.0 was there only because my Calc II grade hadn't been submitted yet
Lol
Niel, I joined you in the college 4.0 club!
*Mr. Spangler
ok
Yep! Nick has explosive diarrhea and Niel will be able to make the FIFA tournament and leave early
Tres?

The soccer team should have taken the nets down after their season
You guys realize they have school today, right?
You mean at BC, right?
I would go!
 It's not that I don't have my jersey, it's just that it hasn't gotten here yet
"Robin Thicke is a disgusting man-ug me"

And yeah, Moyes was sent packing
Well, to be fair, neither of those teams were in 16th place in December
Why are you always on there 
Niel you're amazing
@Brian Hoffman we'll know in the coming months
Hopefully! We'll see what happens!
I'm thinking Physics rn
Don't worry though guys, I plan on surviving my four years
Yeah lol they changed their freshman courses to just pass/fail because too many people were committing suicide because it's so hard
Oh, they do
I love you guys so much
Yep!!

So
I should be completely free

We're just going to expect the worst because we don't want you to be blindsided
Verbally
Fight her
WOOOOOOOOOO
Nick who hurt u
Lol what did you expect
Liked for the photo, not the Steelers support
Me neither
Just make sure that she knows you're uncomfortable with her being around her ex. Tell her you understand that she may still have feelings and she can't do anything to change that but that if she wants it to work out between you two, she can't continue to spend time with someone else she has feelings for because that's a recipe for disaster

I'm done after the 15th
Same!! I miss chilling
I saw people send pictures to Danielle of us on TV lol
If anyone was going to win besides us, I would have wanted it to be Portland. Their organization is generally very classy and today we showed we may not quite be ready for another cup yet
I'm proud of us. I'm happy with how the season went - could have been much happier had we won, but happy. Looking at the positives. One game doesn't define our season as a whole. It defined where we ended up but not who we were.
Nooice
Is this better?
Craig distracted by his own pride:
YOU LIKED YOUR OWN GIF
You:
Me:
"would attempt too"

To be fair, Brian is above Nick
HE DOES NOW

Danielle's going to be with me so we're going to need a lot of copies lol
Sounds like being a politician
What do you mean by speech? Like public speaking?

Big teams will, but them getting left out of semifinals will get people wondering about that approach's effectiveness
Seattle and LA both are out and the small markets are getting a lot of attention and respect for the way they're getting things done
I think this change has been coming about and will continue into the following years though 
Four teams with inexpensive teams competing for the cup... this kind of thing can change the culture of the MLS from buying to developing players and I love it
RBNY actually has the lowest payroll in the league
I meant what Logan said lol as in I got a ticket for top deck but intend to get in the Nordecke
Mine was in 205 (aka the Nordecke)
We'll see you there boys
GRAMMAR SERVED BY CRAIG
Craig, are you coming over?
Inexplicable
And we didn't even run Zeke
Over
MSU gets into the title game if they win this game and next week, right?
I am disappoint
They've got the wind behind them
moi
That's what I'm saying! If we're gonna run we might as well feed Zeke
I'm up for pizza!
Drops from Thomas and Marshall wouldn't happen otherwise. I do hate how often we're running Barrett though
Consider the conditions, fam. We wouldn't be running these plays if it weren't cold and wet
shut up
WE ARE
coming from the guy who played with THE SOUNDERS
#1 in Premier League fantasy
I mean, I didn't really go in depth but I was just talking about where each of us is going to school and the basic rundown. But it got me thinking about the fact that we're all still friends and how cool our group is
Craig: that's a good problem to have!
Everyone else: I'm currently describing our friend group to Nathalie (the Floridian friend) and it's making me realize how cool this squad is. We're awesome
Niel playing basketball:
Logan and Nick playing basketball:
There is a very distinct difference between migrants and refugees. We're making decisions with the mentality that these Syrians are migrants - which they are most certainly not.
EXACTLY
check my Twitter for a good anti-Ohio time
I'm finna bruh
Guys, the girl at the counter at a cafe at OSU complimented my name when I got a coffee... I think we're going to get married
Dang he look good. Scruffy.
You mean yes
Niel, do what I did and buy one for the south stands
We'll probably leave campus around 4
I miss the old Craig's grammar
Actually, no
I am but I had to buy a ticket in the south end and will have one of you sneak me into the Nordecke
YAAAAAAAAAAAAS
SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN TO TOOOOOWWWWWWN
I'M TELLIN YOU WHY
YOU BETTER NOT POUT
YOU BETTER NOT CRY
YOU BETTER WATCH OUT
EXPLAIN THAT
IF IT'S NOT TIME, CRAIG, THEN WHY IS MICHAEL BUBLÉ'S "SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN" PLAYING IN MY HEADPHONES
Guys, it's officially time for Christmas music
Incredible
And then you proceed to like your own message
That's a disgusting objectification of the female form, Logan
You may be on to something
That would be a great way to make easy money, actually
NO SURGERY
NO
CRAIG I AM NOT TOUCHING ANY BRAINS
Nah, they're known for being a sports powerhouse
Hopefully I can play soccer for MIT and be part of the problem
Your love, late at night
Nah, Logan's number changed to 1-800-HOTLINEBLING
One goal, two assists from my forward :'-)
Drogba gets two
3-2 Crew
Wow, jerk
I have Howard starting :/
screw Defoe
dang it
But maybe like a Sam Allardyce
We know lol
His legacy is perfect as it is
THEY'D BETTER NOT TOUCH FERGIE
Ponchettino
Moyes
Say, Mourinho
Someone who sucks in the EPL
I think it's probably more likely to get good managers to come in at the end of their careers and make a big impact than getting older players
For example, no player would willingly go to a team like Liverpool. But a load of players would love to play for Klopp and go there as a result
Good managers are always good and attract players who want to play for them
1. That would not happen
2. That would be preferable to getting old, previously good players
You should do "Dwyane" instead
That would be awesome
What a goal
I figured not lol I don't blame you
Comforting Sounds FTW
You should listen to more Birdy
Nick, please elaborate on this dream
I'm saying Portland with home field advantage
Who do you think takes it on pens?
That bit is definitely exciting
I'm watching it lol the actual soccer is absolute garbage though
Is that sarcasm or
Heck yeah they are
Logan: "You weren't fat"
dang he sexy
Wouldn't expect any less
MY SHINY TEETH THAT GLISTEN, JUST LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE
MY SHINY TEETH THAT SPARKLE, ADDING BEAUTY TO MY FACE
I'm a bitter old man
Yup
Lol I honestly think it should be but I don't want Nick to win it
You do a sufficient job of recognizing your own
Yeah, Logan just did
Did you get an award
The Supporter's Shield is not recognized by em el ess soccer.com
You mean adding?
nah fam
Alright, that's fine
Yo Nick, would it be possible to get playoff tickets for the Nordecke from you for cheap?
Chelsea's looking sharp today
We're on the rise
Take a gander at the EPL table, boys
MAKE THE PATIÑOS PROUD
LOGAN LET'S GO
Congratulations to the victors
dirty dump
idek
Logan, get over it
My right hand knows more about sports than any of your girlfriends 
Totally mine
Because Ronaldo is goals
You right
I should probably watch the new season so you guys stop ruining everything for me
Except maybe Craig
I don't think any of us is Taco
I get Jenny and Logan gets Sophia or whatever her name is
It's settled
Who's the biggest  sarcastic dick in our group
Suck it I get Jenny
YEET
Questionable
YES
I literally haven't looked at MLS fantasy in about ten weeks
Wait there are semifinals? What?
Are you criticizing Bernie's platform, sir
I was screaming
I can't believe no one's freaking out more about that game
ABC
THE REUBEN SANDWICH HIMSELF
In some senses, yes. Ethically, no
Not to mention that telling certain people to not reproduce is eugenics, something popularized by Hitler
Lol having preferable genes passed down does sound appealing. But preference is relative to individual bias
BRIAN WTF
How is it possible to be that centrist lol
Lol prally

Logan, it appears we have the same beliefs on each topic
I BELIEVE IN BERNIE
That man is a hero
I compared my answers with Bernie's and we had the same responses to LITERALLY EVERY QUESTION

What about my girl Triangle?
Yeah, I drank a total of 0 beverages 
Jell-o seems kind of childish, does it not?
I mean does MIT have the ability to grow a top class nurse as myself
Thanks
It's all good, just a lot of money that they promised that made me come here. I could have been at tOSU for cheaper but I came here because the discount would of made it worth it but hey
Okay, thanks guys
That last part was for you guys
Year of 2015
Your help is appreciated but if you don't want to I understand, Zack....get it 
hings changed to where it was 25% through junior year and 100% senior year if you sign for a extra year to work for MCHS. Which stunk but wasn't bad because the 100% would offset the 25% you would of said on junior year. I was just now informed that now it is only 25% for all 4 years and that's it. I talked with Kathy Smith and she said that the program was "discontinued". What about the students that were promised this discount?  That discount was one of the draws to MCCN, because it would save me and many other colleagues of mine money. 
Dear President Schumacher,

Hello, I hope everything is going well at your newly appointed position. My name is Craig Casto, I am a second year student here at Mount Carmel College of Nursing. I know you are probably busy with many emails and questions with this position but I hope this one won't get lost in the pile. Im contacting you to ask about the situation with the student discounts for my class. Back in 2015 I visited this school and they said that freshman and sophomores get 25% off tuition and juniors and seniors get 50% off if you work the required hours, sign to work a year after graduation with Mount Carmel Health Systems (MCHS), and fill the paperwork. When I arrived freshman yeah of 2015 that was reiterated and we were told the same thing upon opening meetings. Midway through my first semester t
Tweeting and how I should finish it
Okay my school is going to shit and I need advise on my soon email but here is background. Soooooo basically my current nursing class is shitty because the new teacher is horrible, she has no idea what she is saying and decided to be and instructor after being kicked off her clinical unit three times. Also a junior class has been having the same problem to the point they had to have a meeting for our classes. THEN the president/dean of the college stepped down Wednesday. NOW! When I was looking at the school the promised 25% off through sophomore year and 50 through senior. Changed half way through freshman year to 25 through junior and 100 senior if you agreed to a extra year with the health system. So it was less tempting but still a great deal where it made me stay and a lot of people come here. Well they just said (this month) fuck it and said it's only 25% every year. Leaving me and a couple hundred students fucked. So I'm sending an email, I need your spell check, suggested
I say we have a wabooba or a spikeball tourney
I'm not in for I don't watch college basketball
What?
I hope that isn't a signal of what our year is gonna be.
Close your legs you whore! @Zsteffen
We suck #CrewSC
I like Chicago or NY or Atl
So what crew away game are we going to? 
Okay I'm down let's book it
Okayyyyyyy what in the heck are we doing for the beach 
I really should start taking notes
I could go Higuain but he is leaving soon more than likely
I would go for him but I dont know if he will stay/start
Or "The Cryptonic Punch"
I'll get Craig "the kryptonic punch" Casto
Ola Kamara 
I'm not happy
Waylon
And will the black be a V neck because I don't want it round. I want it to be different from last years
I'll get you one from the crew shop?
I want the checkers on the black
I wish the black had the checkerboard on the side
I love both of those
Am I the only one?
Won't let me load it
Show the group 
Well let's see it

Bro, you on break this coming week!?
When you realize Vince Vaughn voices espn 30 for 30s
I feel bad for people who aren't informed about the severity of their condition
Will they Change the design of the black ones?
I probably won't be able to either due to school raw doggin me 
The one where you can meet all the crew organizations and stuff
Why is 👆🏽guy so trigger happy
Yeah, now that I hold a season ticket I need a real kit for myself 
I want to see some new Crew kits!!!😡
I'm gonna be honest, I  I bought that that was Nick😂
And ground problems 
Rude
Dude*
BLART this is harassment at this point side
Because we have to shuffle decks
I didn't think it was
The GAF head sucked, I was kicking some ass in a d-d-d-d-ddddddddDULE and I draw that pics of garbage of a card
Craig "The conquistador of punch" Casto
Can we all agree that nick obviously created Craig the Crippler
FUCK BLART
For my YuGi card
"Giant BAMF head"
Sliccc Niccc
Big Nicccc

Well everyone I guess since you all forgot I'll be the one who will remind you. Happy B-Day Nick! Where would this friend group or our family be without your witty and superior jokes and laughter 🎂🎉🎊🎁🎈🛍
You're one fucked up guy blart
You stupid idiot Blart! You need to check yourself before you wreck yourself 
BLART, no it's not man!
Why you lying blart
BLART
Go die you rent a cop
Is he gone from the chat forever?
I could go forearm under the anticubital area
Kinda like when you mistakes grandpas panther for a anchor 😂😂😂
If you pay for it
 I think that that sounds way better than my idea, consider it done
And sarcasm is not appreciated 
Well where would you suggest
That's why I'm asking group to see what they thought 
I mean I was thinking tricep, bicep forearm(top or bottom) chest, or calf. It's more for me but I don't mind if it's visible, I just don't know what would look best
Okay boys, give me all the criticism. Thinking of a tattoo, I dont know where I'd get it or if I could even afford it. I was thinking of it being the outline of Ohio and inside it said family or home on it because it'll always be where my home/family is....and yes nick I'm away Jim and Melissa live in Michigan
I'm talking about the La/NY thing you idiot
So I'm officially ready, and Nick what were you talking about?
And after having an open dispute with my seller for the last two weeks. Ali express stepped in and said I deserve a refund two days ago....my Jesery came in today
What are you talking about
I'm just saying they are horrid at time management
1st two hours of class; 36 slides
3rd hour of class 36 slides
20 minutes after class was supposed to end 36 more slides 
Rt Brian, so what would you do at NASA/Microsoft
Now I know everyone is thinking "It's McCoy's birthday and his best friend won't even say happy birthday" well sorry but we save the best for last here. @poonslayer Happy birthday bromigo! 
Can't even beat serbias D team
Don't know what you're talking about, are there still pickup games at OSU
I hate heroclix so there goes that game for me
Tell me about the game, is it like the GBA Pokémon
Nahhhh I'm playing YUgioh
I was kicking it up into the air working on my traps, ball went a little left and landed straight down 
For those confused, my ball has been punctured by the fence☹️
I just wanted to juggle at the school
I think I grew out of the allergy so the joke is on you
Gotta say, you never know the value of a fanny pack until you're at the gym with wireless headphones and don't wanna carry your phone/have to keep track of it 
I mean how many are you accounting for?
My number is because we said we wanted better this year
Well I'd say personally 150-200? 225 would probs be my ceiling since we'd still have to pay for gas and food
Okay, so for Myrtle this year we have Logan, Zach, Nick and I as a confirmed. McCoy, you said you're going right? Or is that a more than likely but maybe not depending on summer stuff with school? And then a maybe in Neil right? 
First
Well bro, Arsenal is one of the best teams in the Prem. What do you think they expected out of their new coaches dirt game?
..I do need to buy an authentic crew Jesery this year 
Digglett 
Jesery Update: Still in unknown airspace 🛫
Are the schedules out yet?
That's why I asked what the crew offer, they may have cheaper seats. But I think any of those sound nice. I like big cities 
What does the crew offer?
Just to get there
What sucks is both are 2 days of driving 
I mean I hear Seattle is a amazing place. Or Portland even
Went
Sooo I'm just trowing the idea out there, I know this one is a major stretch. So we want to Toronto last year for a game...Seattle this year?
They way I see it; does the alpha lion let other lesser lions near his lioness? No, he doesn't let her catch the sent of a lesser lion. You fuck that lion up, you're the alpha Brian.
Well I'm not going to be a pharmacist nor am I? I just need to know what is important for when I administer it and how to identify if giving a certain drug is a risk due to a pt.'s condition 
This is dookie
We have to know all side/adverse effects, how to identify if a drug would fall jn a certain category (sulf or sulphs for solfinamides) and precautions 
So. Many. Antimicrobials. So little. Time
Which one? The white has no name
Does players mean that you can get them?
Doesn't look like that on the phone
Does it say on the site? It doesn't tell me that
Shit, I just got a paycheck....here it goes
Yes, it was truly mind boggling 
That moment you watch a guy who is AT LEAST 60 incline bench 315
7 am
Well you guys enjoy the hangs, I have clinical Friday
I was thinking tonight 
If you do hang out I can hang
I'm in Pataskala
So what are we doing Bros
I'm 100% sure so get on my level 
I'm good, and same with my kit
Forgot you're on a cruise
We getting together? Bro out?
I dont know what those middle two things even are
When your coworker comes to you complaining of heartburn and asking what to do. Recommended small meals and if it stays that way to see the doctor. She then says ibuprofen has helped, you then Inform her that it's okay to use it every now and again but it's not smart to use NSAIDs frequently. She then is talking at work Friday (6months later) talking about how she had a upper endoscopy done and she apparently had GERD, then she says how she also has a stomach ulcer as well 😑 she took ibuprofen for 6 months when I said not to...and gave herself a ulcer and now she has to follow a crap diet. Should of listened, people are idiots

My exam is over pathophysiology, which is mostly cancer in our class so I'm enjoying it
Last two exams tomorrow then work all weekend 
I'm pretty sure you've said that every year to every season
I have to say I like how close the league is half way through.....besides Niel
She's probably wanting to put the pussy on the chain wax man
Or she "sent it to the wrong person"
Also, think sliced toast? Your definition is wrong, Texas Toast is thick sliced bread NOT thick sliced toast based off what you're saying.
When a Nord stumbled upon the local tavern and asked for their freshest of sliced toast from the land of Texas.....garlic covered thick toast was what he received
Julie!? Her opinion on the Texas Toast debate has about as much weight as mine would at a talk about computer programming
If you ask 10 people I guarantee 8 say it's what is pictured above. The other two are just really dumb
When you came home and saw this bag, you know there was about to be hella spaghetti 
This is OG Texas Toast, this was before those other guys, the imitators, the fakes, the copy cats.
Customs has held my Jesery
One down.....4 to go
Logan, why would you captain a defender...against Manchester 
And you're ahead of me, spoilers man
That is the new dictionary definition of a save 
I literally just splooged everywhere 
Doesn't soccer
Yes but for a good 4 min I was watching every change of play like "oh here it comes"
With every ounce of my being
I hate you 
Don't say anything, I'm only in the 97:45 min
This game, I don't want extra time 
Who's watching the game
I need to proof read my messages more 
Damn it auto correct 😂
Well mister grammar; you're missing a few your missing a comma in your message. Can you tell me where one belongs?
Is that The White House?
What are they all for
Dude you're a idiot and I have no idea
One exam down, one more and 4 finals to go
I mean I saw stuff on Ali so I did it off it? Is that okay?
Jesery on the way from Ali 
..come on man
I'm in
....I'm invited 
I work the 1st so I won't be attending 
Do a New Years kind of deal
Our fantasy league is really close rn

Yeah my roomie and I are listening to the police scanners 
Point
Listening to police scans, someone is in the Lane Ave garage being held at gunpiunt
People are dying and that's "neat!"!?
Guy, be a hero
Go tackle the gut
You mean Chicago
Dude you should have said you were transgender 
I'll be late, nick is taking forever to buy a tree
I will arrive at 7:10
I work at 6 am so I'll need to go to bed around 1 so I'll be out
Yeah get him to Columbus and say find a ride Biach 
So what, be there around 7?
Are we still all hanging out
I'm kidding guys, when do you want me there
I'll be there...if I'm still allowed
Anyone else having issues with finding soccer jerseys on Ali?
I hate how the US has rushed into a decision on the coach
I feel we are screwed now for qualifying 
Well if we go to McCoy's one may be there, if not we'd have to bring one
Logan does you dingbat
Yeah, and will food and ps4s be provided or will we need to bring some?
As everyone is anxiously awaiting my answer I am happy to inform everyone I will be attending the Thanksgiving break get together...if I'm invited
When you realize the LA Galaxy is sponsored by a Pyramid scheme
Make sure to include who previously got you jerseys 
By Friday 
Intentionally walk people...both times fuck you over

Did anyone else know that the MLS did shootouts like hockey during the playoffs? Back in the day
CLEVLAND V. Toronto AGAIN!!
Actually said I was 21 so only a year off
Yeahhhhh I like the it's not broke so why fix it, it's already exciting enough. I don't wanna watch teams lose 12-1 because that's just ugly soccer and would rather watch close games. 
Yeah I don't see why change it if it's not broken. Changing the tourney doesn't fix the corruption that happened
How do you decide the teams who do and don't have to play to get in?
48 teams with a play in round
Thoughts on the new proposal for the World Cup
Everyone say hello to the new 2016/17 season ticket member of Columbus Crew SC⚽️
Hitting my stride at the right time. Sorry Brian but not tourney for you
Whenever Columbus loses is the day they won't have it anymore
Just like good ole Brett, and true. BC got smacked

D. Yed just signed with Newcastle
The name is actually kind of messed up but I'm happy with it
It's not the top one, but it's the 60 dollar one. It has a name on it, now worth 80. And it was only worth 18 so screw you
It's beautiful
I'm not worried if you abort it adopt or whatever. I'm just gonna say for the fact of how much more time you'll have to put in with the child, which would effect work and things of that nature if you would decide to go a different way
Moral Question of the Night:
If you took the blood test to find out if your kid had any diseases/disabilities (still in the placenta) and found out it had trisomy-21; would you keep it? (Weather or not you abort it or put the kid up for adoption I'll leave out of the question)
But that's the only guy
Especially to a stupid number, who is number 14? Wtf kind of number is that
The moment you get a jersey of yea boy and he changes numbers😐
How does BPL work, head to heads or just a table off points
Ccamcasto@gmail
Dude she's got it😳
Hmmm, well I left my green waterbottle at your house. I think I'll be by Thursday it Friday to get it if that's possible
Is anyone at the Patiño house

FUCK
Is the game this weekend?
I couldn't tell you guys

No?
If that's to late tell me
5:45
I'm on my way home
I'll came if I can head home first, at Abby shikys
Where!? Who
What's going on
Someone quick update
https://media2.giphy.com/media/POql6zsXZbmcE/giphy.gif
Yeahh I'll be making a trip to Alaska or Greenland to get me a snowrunt
It looks so dumb
It's funny to watch nick try to like this game
Nope
Then you bring up these new teams and if their are DP players and they get relegated then what?
Because they never start their full rosters because they don't care. I
Because they lost to a team that the crew beat 4-0 and you are making fun of the crew now for being at the bottom of the table. It would be embarrassing 
But they wouldn't come close
And the league is already so close. Last year Colorado would have been relegated...this year they are topping the table 
But it's gonna generate 0 if a team is relegated. They will lose all support
Your team didn't even beat them, they LOST.

Wait are we for real!?

Okay, last time I ask for hair help😳
A true Timmy 
Crying, and im also sorry to inform the group that I will be cutting my hair before vacation. I'm open to suggestions 
I mean I'm assuming we will be seeing them anyway. I make zero promises 
Again, I do but I really would rather find someone who wants a relationship
😂😂😂😂
Even more sad, I like my girls cute
Is she got doe?
Oh my lord, and yeah it's disappointing how I don't have any desire for sex with random people😂😂😂
Hey man, as fun as it sounds I'm looking for a more permanent woman in muh life.
You can get em both bro! First of the group to have a threesome 
Hahahaaaaaa, well tell her thanks for the offer but I don't have she supply for the demand. This D is saved for my future boo boo thang
We haven't even been there yet bro😂
Big Destroyer 
They are mostly the same
That's expensive though, I think they would fit you 
You can also get a cart for it for a extra 5
Mostly a matching set of Wilsons
@poonslayer @Logan Patiño 20 bucks

He broke his toe a week ago! Come on
Let me know 
When and who with
I'm free
Why?
McCoy, did you and Logan do your passport stuff today?
Passport is on the way
McCoy look out, Zach Flueki just slid into Mel's DMs
Oh, okay lol nevermind I thought it was in June.
The game is at the end of next month right?
I just didn't want you guys to be done when I got there
I'll be there around 4 if that works for you guys
Hey, I get off work at 3, do you guys need or want my help moving the rest of the sand?
Or McCoy 
Hey Logan, is it okay if I show up around three?(volleyball)
Sports center says it's official :)))))
MOURINHO TO MANCHESTER!!!!!

Today is the birthday of a true legend
Note we were wrestling for a minute and a half before I said you're dumb and stopped
He just sat there, I stopped because he claimed he was "playing D-fence". So I quit because he wasn't actually arm wrestling he was just sitting there
Okay first off they were louder because they scored in 5 seconds and we are all pissed, then they scored a second crap goal after the ball was clearly out. Our fans couldn't get into a game that we were being screwed over in the first 20 min. 
When does this event start?
One MLS player on the USA roster...it's Tim H.....who probably won't even start in the first place
There is a lot of potential for table movement this week. 
I listened to it and he is supposed to go to Philly if the MLS works how it is supposed to with new players.
"Suspicious"  package at Old Trafford 
Any opinions on the USA-Mex joint bid to host a World Cup
Is that a no?
Spike ball?
Sooooo July 31st; Crew SC v. Toronto FC at Toronto?
#true
I heard its upward of 300,000
Good news is we will be making a crap ton off him
I mean Crew wouldn't let go of him unless they had a backup
This sucks, let's go Ola Kamara then. 
Hey what's up, is everyone still at the Patiño house?
Who all is over and what's going on?
Ehhhhh I dont know
Not like Karen, she is the true bæ.
I'm at the point where F and The P have met and Matt has been missing all the trials. I don't like him with Electra, I like him to be with Karen better. I feel she is gonna end up with floppy which I don't want and he shouldn't be with the stupid head 
I don't want Matt to be with Electra 
DareDevil has me 🎣
E. 3
Nooo this is my kind of woman. And my kind of show
She is gorgeous
I would marry Karen Page
It happened in the first ten min, the next twenty for me were uneventful
Then*
Today at OSU I catch the ball between my thighs, jump and push it forward than volley it in for the game winning goal.....only thing I did in 30 min
Thing*
It's the same think but one is with two grown men
But this is a foul? I don't get it

This is cute
(This is from fortune magazine)
And fun fact of the day Ohio contains four company's  in the top 100 company's to work for in 2016 and two of them are hospitals, one is some company I dont know and the other is Nationwide Mutual Insurance
Or just save up for a legit one
I know but it's from Ali and I didn't know if I wanted to risk it and buy one from it
Nick got a Crew one, or at least he told me he did, and I want to know how it looks before I buy mine
Forgot to ask @Nick Casto , how good is the CrewSC jersey you got
I'll need enough for 32 hours
No, we earn plt every paycheck but it's only like 2 hours per check 
I can't ask for any more days off if I want to go on vacation. We HAVE to use PLT if we want to call off and I need to have enough for Myrtle so I'm out
I mean I feel we all work during the week so Friday-Sunday is probably best
We should go on a bro camping trip
So is anyone looking to see the new movie with Key and Peele
Yes
I mean if you were able to buy two next season id pay you on the spot with cash
I mean I know know there is a list and that current holders get theirs first, so I didn't know if I couldn't get you to buy two and I'd pay you
Certainly not for Chelsea 
Can I get 
Hey bro, for the 2017 season tickets through you?
Take out the been*
Okay that's like telling Shaq he was bad at free-throws when he played for the Celtics. It was his 19th season and he was been bad every season before. It's my 19th year of bad grammar, why are we still surprised about this?
At Slither.io
I'm to good 
So if Cavs make finals, we going on a trip to Cleveland
Or the hangover fries 
The Cuban war pig is sooo good
I work 6-11:30 with bill then 12:30-10 with MCW
I would but I work this weekend from 6a-10p
YOURE GOING TO THE MELT
RT 
I have that!!!!! And I wouldn't want to work with C. diff, I see enough old people with it when I work to know I'd take a hard pass on that.
😳 C. diff
That's scared to think about how many places do that with so many different bacteria and microbes
Yeahhh, I prefer to go to a place and learn to save someone rather than kill someone.
Dude, he is doing a lot better than Costa. And Pato has nothing on Lukaku.
Lukaku is coming back to the Bridge baby
I sadly bring out the best in people
This makes my blood curl
I hate fantasy soccer more than anything
Brian wins😡
Well nevermind that, no one on my bench played 😂😂😂😂
😘 luv you
I have subs coming too
I have Castillo and Urruti too there Brian😘
I'll chip in
Did you buy it?

Prediction: 2-2
I have to save my money for new breaks and tires for my car; I also have to save for room and board next year for I want to pay out of pocket
Everyone I saw McCoy two days ago, first time I've seen anyone in this group since soccer golf
And get my paddle
Think of how much he hurts right now, he played the whole game 😂😂😅
I mean he was the only player talked about really so he is #1
He is my fave, I was bandwagon when he was #8.
Yeah, you can't miss a farewell to Kobe. A top 10 maybe even top 5 great!
I'm happy I stayed up for this
It took him 20 years, but he finally passed
HE IS EVEN PASSING THE BALL
I mean I wouldn't be surprised if La paied the Jazz to lose but still. 60 POINTS
This is insane, 50+ in his last game
He has ice in his veins man, even at 37 man. This is crazy
Is anyone watching Kobe's last game?
So you may get me, I have two people not playing
I didn't even know this week started this early
I'm down 
You're doing a triathlon aren't you?
Is anyone else here doing the marathon besides Neil 
Bro, we aren't horrible. Just to have a cool bro time
I say we try to find a golf course for vacation.
What was that sentence 😂
He honestly didn't play that he played bad in my eyes
He hasn't been bad, I would say he has played well
I feel bad for Sunderlands goalie, he is killing it while the team plays like complete trash
It's at the farm now
That amazing moment where you get free BCCAs with your purchase of protein 
Matt Mizaga has been horrible for Chelsea today
You guys are doin it too?
http://cdn.meme.am/instances/250x250/57306047.jpg
That would be a no
OF COURSE I KNOW IT!
DOES TRUMP WANT TO BUILD A WALL?!?!
ITS SETTLERS OF CATAN
But if in person we prefer it in cash; singles only.
That goal was killer
Second week straight I've had the second most fantasy points in MLS and I play the person with the most.
I know, my boy is cementing his spot for next year. This kid is going to be amazing
Is anyone watching sports nation
I mean, we are seeing where it goes. But it's looking good
Yeah, we are currently conversing 
I'm not "messing" with her at all
You're so stupid
What?
@Brian Hoffman 
She will be, hopefully
I feel a lot is with attendance too, now yes the men's team isn't bringing in crazy numbers, but the women aren't even coming Close to the men I assume
And not at all
Well I'm tryin to make her my bæ, and did you hear about the USWNT filing for wage gap suit?
She isn't my anything lol, I have bæ
Yeah I almost forgot to thanks bro
I'll be at gp in 20
Nick you sill up?
Sorry I didn't do exact numbers
The stadium only holds like 16,000
There is a sneak peak
Has anyone seen the stadium for Nigeria and Egypt?
The plot, it thickens😳
I don't think I'm going to go. Thanks for the offer but I just remembered 
I have a anatomy test on Wednesday, I need to study for that. 
Well wait
Yes unless you can/ want to sell it
I dont know, it sounded weird
The United States have
United States has

And they always get red cards in big games, no fault of wenger 
They need a real striker, lest be honest G and Wekbeck are not and won't be world class strikers like Kün or Costa(in prime)
How could you fire him, Arsenal has been one of the most consistent finishers in the past decade because of him
Your math is wrong 
My left side is the bigger side
It sucks when you lift and notice how Un Proportional you arms are 
It sucks

In a actual game
You guys haven't beat me since I have obtained my paddle
All games
Well I actually only won  two sets. It was 2-3 0-3 0-4 0-3. But I kept app games within 3
Just played table tennis for three hours straight at Columbus' ping pong club, I have sores on me feet and hands. I never say down once
No Allen Iverson?

After 3 and a half hours I have prepared for my week
Oh you said that
It D-nags
The work cup 2010
Is there still a penalty for to many transfers in a week?
Beer
I feel that Portland could have a cool tifo
Here is my pitch

The Portland team is hoisting the trophy in front of the Nordeke with confetti flying
Then there are bear cans flying toward them
And it says "Stay Classy Columbus"
We are away
At Portland
They just won a MLS cup
Against us
There fans are gonna be nuts
Players and fans will want some revenge for out bear shower
Let's see who can predict the most games correct this year 
2-2 
SCORE PREDICTIONS
Everyone it's that time again
Logan, thank you. I didn't see last nights messages

My app or Jozy
You'd have to educate them obviously, and anyone (more than likely elderly will need it) who would be at a hospital could learn
Bro, my app makes sense. It's would turn your phone into a pulse oximeter 
What would that be used for? And how do you take it normally (not counting drawing blood) 
You can also let it detect pulse also just to add more to it
I dont know if you still need the app logan, but make a app that uses the light of your phone to measure your SaO2 concentration in blood.
Annndddd Arsenal has lost their title chance
I dont know, McCoy and I had a pretty bad club team our first two years
Is she ugly, are you judging a book by its cover nick?
 When your dad is so cool that Reese's Puffs is his cereal of choice
Nothing man, just wasn't a lot of points and didn't know what was happening.
Logan, Brian and Neil, are you even playing?
Arsenal being Arsenal
I'm in
You just go to join private leave and enter the code
What's the code
So how do I get into our fantasy group? Do I make my team then join the league or what?
Like a wanna see a damn eagle 
Either way I think it look really bad, I like the "old" crest better also.
No
It's ugly
Apparently we are getting a new crest too
Black with a blue and a red sleeve
Has everyone seen the leaked new USA kits
Summer classes 
I actually might be on campus
Ccamcasto@gmail.com
My car is the same year as yours
And I never dated salmon
  Same as yours bro but different model and about 150000 less miles
Everyone meet Shannan, she is my new used car.
The earth is actually flat, pictures from "space" are a lie.
The missions to mars aren't real either, just a ploy to make Russia spend their money on a "space race" and lead to them going bankrupt.
Whoopse
I haven't had a extra carb since 2004 four, you see these, I live with these every day.
Is everyone off the last week of this month?
It's funny for me because I've seen Nick lose his cool and say sh**(indoor) but I can't imagine him in someone's face 
http://p1cdn01.thewrap.com/images/2014/09/celebrity-big-brother-140913-gary-busey.jpg
They are beautiful but after some time they lose there beauty and become nothing but a place where you live. I love the beach, it's sunny and awesome. But after a week they im more than happy to be here in Ohio
Our 16 cousins and 9aunts and uncles live here and out mom and dad. Nick will make enough money to go wherever he wants to on vacation, family is everything.
Our whole family is here Neil; this is home. We love this place, why would we ever leave
You won't? You are going to be a pharmacist, if your company wants you to move...find another hospital
I'm ashamed all of you are leaving too
Don't worry bro, it's only until I find my red haired beauty
I'll be in Ireland and or Scotland 
I'm saving up for my season ticket next year!
Brian face timed me randomly with his lady
The face time call, with your girl

If you have head gear I'll do it
So yes?
It's honestly really fun 
?
Did you get head gear!
No, but it was cold enough I ran inside and it picks songs based on your pace so you run on beat and it feels amazing
Spotify is amazing for running, fun fact of the day
We don't like him, he is cheap and scores. 
Now why does Walcott not start, see what happens
Cećh is still God in the goal 
Work flow

Sports Illustrated Swim suit edition for this year is coming out and they are revealing ye cover and stuff. Nick has every copy from the last like 7 years
You on TNT @Nick Casto or are you waiting for the actual magazine 
When Costa is your captain and he score and assisted/ was assisted by your midfielder Willian.
The more I see this whole kit the more I'm excited for it.
I want the crew to do that the Dynamo are doing, have the fan send in kit ideas
I really like it
I think the close up looks really good honestly
I mean I'm buying one either way, I don't have a actual crew jersey so this is the one.
It just clashes
Either way, is there a black version of this
Or is there a black version of this
Is the away just like last years?
I might be something that just has to grow on us. 
Well.....that looks horrifying
It's not just spread by mosquitos
Mosquitos and sex
I mean, minus the red and blue it's not that bad
That's not the jersey, why would there be red and blue. If they were black and yellow I wouldn't mind it
Pics
David.....monster 
DDDDDDIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOO
Mikel didn't even touch him
Brian, Tottenham has no chance right now. No one does
Leicester 

When is ready 
It looks real
I mean I just got it cut, so we will see what it looks like I'm two months time 
Because I've hit man bun, what would any longer achieve? I don't want to look like Kyle beckerman 
No it is a like a Kei small bun and doesn't look good, I'm lopping it off
@Logan Patiño I have done it, I have a man bun
Same with nursing but hey, more money with a masters
They have one here, I know I'm doing it
They need Donovan
I hate JJ just signed autographs on the way out of the tunnel
I mean he is getting in good positions 
Finlay's touches and passes have been horrible
Score prediction 4-2 USA 
Chelsea is not takin Terry back, he will be in the MLS next year. Calling it

Now that's my kind of table tennis match
Like caving in Kentucky 
I mean lets at least go somewhere then so it's a exciting thing
Shotgun 
Id say a broad trip but we don't have a big vehicle
Scratch that, try to pull a tube behind it
Go to a lake, rent a boat for a day and booze cruise 
Canada
Road trip to Cali
I think everyone would 
Does anyone here still have rapchat?
What about the beach, any news on that
Can't make transfers in the July 2016 or Jan 2017 Windows I think it is
Hear about the Atletico and Real Madrid bans?
She actually does bro
Because as a nurse we deal with people with many different practices and they want us to be respectful and know why. Our teacher is a person who actually teaches priests in the the Catholic Church, and is very biased.
We are learning about he heart and blood, so not bad but strugglin. I also have to actually apply myself in the micro class I have and I have to suffer through a religions class
But finished top two
I had Defoe and two 7 pointers on my bench
To*
Lookin fresh on the elevator up yo my job interview.
So is the positive or negative after your blood type say if you are Rh positive or negative?
And Zack asked when is the beach @Nick Casto 
At?
The top of a Light and Fit yogurt cup. It never comes off as one piece for me, but today I did it
I did it, hole top with no stragglers
When do we draft for next segment, like when can we pick our teams?
And I'm rockin a mex tux
Well I leave to MCCN around 6
Bro coffee trip
Will Trapp is ranked 43 on the Bleacher Report's "100 players to watch in world football in 2016"
So soccer field anyone?
Basically...I'm good
I go back no later than Saturday, I don't mind not being able to attend if need be
Yes but I'm not going to fuel my brother to make fun of me

Ccamcasto@gnail
You guys all owe me 2.50 for pizza
I've hit every light, no joke
Do I need them, how about that
What about my gloves? Have they been discovered
Sooooo what's going on
Yeah
Having a table tennis training montage 
That ban by FIFA though
That's not a option
I said Trumoo too 
Okay everyone, if you are getting chocolate milk would you rather have nesquik, trumoo or no preference 
They were on three weeks ago  I know that 
Just let me know when and if you're leaving, and the white ones on wheels are always there I think
We are from BC, it's to cold for gym 
Does that matter?
I'm heading home now from TJ Max and  then I'm going to field 
When is this happening so I know how long I have at stores
Not like you're gonna score 😂😂
What time are we looking at
I could go
When your roommate moves out without giving you a warning and takes all the cups, bowls, steak knifes and silverware 
If by work out you mean run 4 miles...every day but weekends
I get two, Nick "Slick as Silk" Casto vs Craig "The Conquistador of Punch" Casto
Those to might as well not be on the field because they aren't doing anything
Well yeah because hazard is literally a shell of what he was last year and Costa is plain GARBAGE so far. 
They were so good at scoring and then just playing good defense...this year the back line is horrible
And they aren't playing at all like they did last season, they aren't sitting back and hitting the counter. 
No but let's be honest here, Chelsea has the talent to be AT LEAST 10th.  The players are just playing like they don't care at all. 
...it's a dumb decision, Man City didn't sack their manager when they were playing horribly after they won the league....nor did United. It's one bad season, he just won you the League last season. If the players are unhappy with him I guess I can understand it, but he shouldn't be sacked because of this start
I got my jersey today
....such a bad move
I saw the video of him signing all of those
Well I am so you have to include that into the scheduling
We have Christmas at the Fair's also nick
And the pay gap is because there is more audience for men's sporting events compared to the women's. You can't match the pay when you don't make the money to do so
I should be free, maybe job interviews. Christmas at the Fair's also
There has been a lot of muscle atrophy of my muscles though since last year.
I didn't even get to participate in the first one because of a shoulder injury! I would of killed it that year! 
Thought id remind everyone who the champ is right now
While though it's possible I doubt it, they have the players to win obviously (they won last year). They just started horribly, and they know it's to late to get to the top so they just don't care. I doubt they play like this all season, they will get it together, win a few games and get around 9 or 12th on the table.

Because nick still has a chance to keep is balls, you've lost yours already. It's too late for you
But if you trust her I guess that's a good thing though so that part doesn't matter
Yeah, but you don't want her to be hanging with her ex who she "still loves". She has all she needs in you, distance is hard but it's worth it if you two like eachother
Not necessarily break up with her, but tell her you're not confertable with the whole hanging with the ex. I mean that just seems like a lifeboat 
I'm in the library now studying endocrine hormones for my anatomy and physiology exam tomorrow 
That annoying moment when your captain doesn't get more points than your goalie......or defender
Are we all watching the Barclays Boxing Day like we did last year?
Nope, I was just wondering because I know it's on moms laptop and desktop
No I was just wondering lol
I was
Should I get Norton on my Mac
P1s-Pharmacy 1??
Yep, I know for anatomy if I want to finish with a A I can't get anything lower than a 70, for Biochemestry nothing lower than a 77 and in psychology I have to get a 95 on the final for a A
Thanks guys
Oh and noones name is being used in the paper
Thank you Niel
That would be your answer to #2
Yes it does my friend
I have a English paper I have to write after I do a survey.
Please help me out and just answer these three questions?
Have you ever used your phone or MP3 while driving?

If so, what are you usually doing?


Even though by now you have been informed about distracted driving, why aren't you worried about an accident?

Did you keep the flags?
Have you guys left yet
We will probably pass. If it's busy we won't be able to get there at 1:30 
This is nick by the way
There 
What time did you plan on going three 
The church crowd is going to sloops and it will be packed 
Nevermind 
To eat?
Are we all going out befor the game?
About went American Psycho on em
http://fanart.tv/fanart/movies/1359/moviebackground/american-psycho-4ff951c78a025.jpg
SEE
Yeah I'm going to the one on campus
Oh yeah the panera by campus yes lol 11th
I'm by the nationwide building
I dont care 😂 I was just gonna go to Panera but if you guys wanna go elsewhere. (I'm 30 min away)
Portland fans....all over Columbus 😳 I'm walkin to OSU now for some pre game grub
Nick I'm kidding, you know. like I'm so excited, I'm already there because I'm a crazy fan....I was kidding
I'm already outside the stadium😳
Yes
That would be a no
I wouldn't wanna walk home haha
Yeah? I'll need a ride home though
I was just gonna walk?
For what
...24 hours
That Pirlo part put me to tears
To bad that would never happen, and it's been proven by how well you guys were at the last free kick shoot around 
Year yeah*
My freshman yeah, I get reminded ever time I go to a game
Ehhh, the kick was mediocre

And also to the giff labeled "me", that is the WORST wall placement, I wouldn't do that. So you wouldn't have scored it on me
If you mean "you" as in the goalie...I saved it
If you mean "you" as in the kick taker...planned it
For your free kick abilitys
https://media2.giphy.com/media/wV0XDfE05XZ4s/giphy.gif
I'm not saying it has to be during our Christmas Eve events I was just saying in general. Like how we would go to the field and just take free kicks...well you guys would attempt too
I'm down for just us, but I wanna play some soccer.
Or do it like we did at Myrtle Beach and rotate in teams of two?
So when all get back we have our soccer classic, what about calling up Thomas, Kolin, Kevin H., etc and get some small sides scrimmages or something?

I compare myself to a Sunderland, I started really poor but things are looking up for me.
Logan is spitting 🔥🔥
More like third person from the bottom!
Depending on how the rest of the week goes, Craig might climb another position, out of the relegation zone.
BATMAN DOESN'T USE A GUN
The Ohio State Panera is a great study place
Fine I'm getting there at 1:25
I sent it right after you did!
I'll be there at 1:30
When the gate opens, I need to buy a crew scarf or hat there
I'm ready 
Who will you get to take your shift
HOLY SHIT
I say New York puts up a fight and it'll be 3-1 Bulls but Crew takes the aggregate win
I'm drooling 
That dribbling was so sexy
I spoke*
😳we spoke way to soon
GOAALLLLLLLLLLLL
So boys, first week of June....the beach?
Must of heard McCoy's rants
We should get there earlier if it's at the Crew stadium so we have more standing room
I know how you feel
That's not the Nordecke?
Logan, in row 206!?
Far
Anyone else see the Portland game so fat
Did you guys get out?
"2-2
You guys here?
We are leaving now 
Craig and I*
I just remembered McCoy stole a whole flag from the last game
So no?
Sunny/partly cloudy 
I'll come to you
Yeah? After soccer
Nick, can you take me home from OSU?
Nick, are you going to OSU tonight?
Sorry, didn't know if the summer one was called that or not!
Who's got the winter soccer golf trophy? Me😉

Well I sent in the request, I haven't heard back. You can stay in my room no matter what, I dont know how comfy the couch is though.
I may be on the bottom but I'm slowly on my climb 
That disappointing college moment where your pants don't fit and your belt is to big.
And you won't have to
If not I don't mind if you stay in mine.
I can see if I cant get you a room to yourself.
Are you okay with racism 
Then how can you see why they don't 
#prayforparis 😑
Yed....come on 
Has
He had done it!
Hey guys, sale on Wednesday on Ali. Get the jersey then to save big bucks!
I haven't seen one soccer highlight on ESPN
So everybody, score prediction? I'm going 3-1 Columbus but Impact will score first.
Sorry, are you close? (Trying to improve my grammar)
Are you close
Nick was wondering, we are on the way now
McCoy, when are you guys getting there?
...come on...this again
I dont know, is the president black?
But we will be there
  Is Brian!?
Logan, are you gonna be in the Nor?
And you don't wanna be a cardiologist/mammogramist/neurosurgeon 
McCoy ever since you have come back from MIT you have been making some dangerous choices. Early Christmas music, sneaking your way into the Nor...what happened to you
McCoy are you going to the game?
But then it's not a discount 
STOP THIS 
WHY
YOU ARE A SAVAGE
NO ITS NOT MCCOY, STOP
Remember most of them are 40+
GIVE MAMMOGRAMS 
DERMATOLOGIST 
CARDIOLOGIST 
So*
No is Neurosurgeon not a option?
🖐🏻
Yeah and mine is non-existent sooo no tuition increase here
If that doesn't scream Columbus 
I will
Logan knows all about my score prediction ability. 
You guys are ahead of me
I didn't hear pharmacist can synthesize those now
I'm only a freshman in nursing school but just a thought 
I'm pretty sure you can't be revived after 90 minutes
What minute are you guys in
To Neil
Fav RT
I mean I don't hear complaints about Brad announcing.
Well yeah, Donovan knows what he's talking about. Now yes he is the worst one to pick because of how boring he sounds BUT
The Crew is gonna take game two
2-1 Impact 
Logan, I bet you I can guess everyone's predictions
Sauro
Who is that defender for the Crew?
I'm pissed, I just subbed out LuKaKu for Benteke
They subbed him out for more attack. He's still gonna start, he's young and not used to the speed or physicality yet.
This Everton game
You can't deny that he is a machine right now, I feel the Crew needs a game to figure it oit
2-1 to Boys in blue, Drogba  is to good, but Crew will take game two.
Crew game score predictions for today?
their not there dang it
They would try there luck at a Championship before they came to MLS
Or three 
The MLS defiantly isn't their number two option
Their
Yeah but what manager in there right mind would go to the MLS rather than finish managing in the Barclays 
Shelter is my jam
Already saw them
I was thinking it was Gerrard
Nick, you weren't even close
Oh, okay
I mean I'll drop out so everyone gets a jersey? I'm broke anyway
I'm just stating that not saying don't let him
If Zach wants to do the exchange it would be uneven numbers. 
And the winter soccer golf
So you're the Seattle Sounders, usually top of the table, finish with most points, just no MLS cup
Missed week one, and we were talking about MLS. 
Big words from the bottom of the table 
Petr saves the day...if only Chelsea 
It's a rough life but hey, it's a bad start. It's all about the  finish
I took their picture actually 
No like a will you marry my on a bridge in Columbus 
I just watched a proposal 
You're a bow master not a wizard!
It's LARP bro, you're just mad that you're a sissy wood elf who shoots arrows
I'm the dual axe centaur!
No but they go hard,they were grunting and screaming. I felt I was watching a battle between ancient Nords
I have never seen legit LARP until today, mind it blown.
I almost caught up so I am proud of myself
To much dank
Why does it sound like I'm hearing boos??
A lot of people hate them 
Thanks
What channel is OSU gonna be on
I think he's at grandpas, the whole family was supposed to be going out. I went back to college today 
That punter might get killed
THAT WAS SO...UNBELIEVEABLE
DID ANYONE SEE THAT
Wait, he said absolute fire cracker not wonder.(2010 World Cup, announcers description of a goal)
People, he has been subbing in/starting for awhile. He just came off a great international performance with him even scoring a wonder cracker of a goal.
Yeah, I dont know if he plans to stay at bills long. I know Mel and I aren't
He said we need to watch it somewhere?(are you taking about the soccer game)
I'm not confident
3-1 Mexico

Yes, yes it is. I'm going to join blackpeoplemeet.com

Yeah it's been two months,  I can't restore or anything.  Just boot I to bios,  my guess is a CD will help,  but booting from a USB won't.  
Do any of you guys have a Windows CD I could use this weekend?  My laptop says it has no OS installed and I can't get it to work at all.

I truly believe that's the answer.
Why kill them when we could use them as slaves? Smarter people would always win, and just use them to do our work.  Clean, take care of my cotton farm, free up prison's to save more money. Slavery is the answer. 
Here's a thought: our population growth is logarithmic, but out food growth is linear. There will come a time where we can not supply the food for the idiots of the land. Due to this, I agree. Idiotanise this planet.

I thought I hit the jackpot with the away game trip this year 
Jk. 70 bucks both ways :/
May 22 is crew vs NE at New England. A round trip train ride from Toledo to NE is 70 bucks 
Logan, when are you moving to Boston? 
Jk. Good job 
Like whore 
Im mature 
I ain't boozin no more 
I got work early in the AM
Wish I would have went 
Meram is always running there I guess 
Live 
They both love in the short north 
But you don't have his jersey 
We just got rocket league on PS4 by the way 
Meram definitely flops, definitely is predictable but he is the only person on this roster that isn't scared to take people one v one 
Everyone shits on meram. But they literally don't know how good he was last year and the start of this season. People get pissed he always takes people one on one and loses it but he is the only one that takes people 1v1. And those same people are the first people to get pissed when we pass it to the wings and just cross it 
but then then are you taking Higuaín out?
YES YES 
He better not overtake meram. I'll be pissed 
Hopefully he starts over Finlay
Yeah... I'm very pleased

Brian, this is the most I've seen you into college basketball 
They won the big ten. They have all the momentum going into the tourney. Easy pick for me 
Maggie calling up da phone twice in 4 days. 
I wish you were serious 
We get chances and we can't score. Pipa literally one on one with the keeper and could easily dribble around him,  it goes for a chip. Meram couldn't find the net with the goalie out either. Frustrating 
I wish the crew would have scored a goal in the run of play 
I hated views at first. But it really grew on me.

I also would take out  the getting lost in a pile. Don't wanna necessarily assume your president is just spamming your emails or ignoring it. He would not take that lightly most likely

But that email is good. I would be pissed and sending an email too
That sucks though. I'm sorry :/
Here is the problem. If MC is going bankrupt, which west is not doing well financially, then they have no choice of cutting back your discount. It sucks. But you either go to MC and graduate or they give everyone a discount and you transfer because the school goes under. 
I wouldn't put the "if you don't want to help I understand". I would also thank him for his time and any consideration
Say you have a friend 
Is she a babe and single?

You have a make up channel 
You're still at work?
I really wish I didn't have an exam tomorrow and could watch basketball 
I really hope the mount wins 
Yeah. I mean, once you get hired as a pharmacist it's probably better. But their intern policies are atrocious. I would rather have clinical to challenge me. Gives me the option to teach which I think I would like to do, and you get something new everyday. Will I end up clinical? Who knows. I don't really know what I want to do yet exactly because I see pros in both sides. We will see though 
Exactly. I had an intern meeting with a higher up dude of Meijer that does the interviews and he said if you're planning on doing a residency, don't even waste my time interviewing. I got so heated sitting there. Like how can you be so freaking stupid. What's wrong with evaluating your options and having a back up plan. Especially when they told us they only hired 4 of their 16 interns from the previous year. Like of course when I hear that I'm going to explore other options, you haven't provided me any job security when I've worked for you for 3.5 years now? And you make me get rehired every year within those five years with year long contracts? Who wants to go through that. 
They go residency because they see how understaffed community is. No one wants to work under some of the conditions some of the pharmacists have to work with. And the fact of the matter is there are more community pharmacies than hospitals, so yeah. You're going to have people leave for residency. But then, all the people that don't get matched and need a job, you're not going to hire them? It's disgusting. Meijer has been getting on my nerves. Very inconsiderate considering the landscape has dramatically changed since they've been in school. But the people making these decisions have over inflated egos that are comfortable and don't give two shits about anyone else. All about then. All about them. Decrease patient care. Decrease employee satisfaction all at the expense of a higher profit. Healthcare in America is terrible. Contradictory and greedy corporations that claim transparency but sit behind tinted glass.   
And that would be INCREDIBLE 
Get this. Meijer is being a bunch of dickholes. MAKING ME WORK WHILE ON ROTATIONS. Basically, if I want a job at meijer, I'm not traveling anywhere. 
One of those places is not participating in march madness, if that makes the decision any easier 
Did you decide between Pitt and Arizona
Only down by seven now? I just got an espn update they were down by 14 with like 8 to play 
This is what I get for not watching basketball. Minnesota sucks. Si pierde eso es un dulce dieciséis equipo que perdía 😩

Zach, I could Evan Baker you this weekend if you want? I'll be the one to take one for the team

Got my yellow kit pre ordered cuz I'm a season ticket holder 
Between Alex Stec and Will Trapp's nips in the kit. I don't know how I'm going to make it through class

@Craig Casto Ever hear of Michael Dublé? French/American comedian in in the early 2010's. His form of humor was largely based on a double delivery or a "win win joke". To explain it to you. Julie had Logans phone. I provided the joke insult knowing that either she would be the direct recipient of the joke or that logan actually had his whole phone the whole time and in that case, it would burn logan. The making it a win win or a double "duble" burn 
I thought logan was acting a little gay today 
Well Pitt is ass at college basketball so don't go there 
Guest
So if you want to die in your sleep because of a scorpion sting. Be my guess
But they have scorpions 
I would say Pitt. Only because it's Midwest. If you get homesick or anything you rally can't come home. Unless you have family or friends down there. Also, there pharmacy building is kinda like hogwarts. You are a steelers fan. You're downtown. 


But Arizona has a better college basketball program so I would consider that too
Whatever he goes by 
Or abubakar 
Craig you have to get lalas
Or just get big nick on the back 
Or Kamara
Or Naess

Im thinking Meram?

Isn't it supposed to be 50s this weekend?
My pharmacology professor is the biggest cavs fan ever. Bought a $600 cavs replica championship trophy 
Cleveland, this is for you!!!!!!
And then one transferred back to his old club. Beloved one moment, trashed on the next. I hope the second stint does well for the confidence and future well being of the player. He deserves it 
Back when we all were on the same team ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Not all of them 
I guess him and the GM didn't get along

How warm will it be? 
I do not know. I doubt it, since everyone likes it. 
Blart, who is the fairest of all fantasy teams 
They're going to be yellow 
It's like at some brew house in Columbus. It's during the week so I can't go but that's when they are unveiling the jersey 
You meet the team and you'll get to see the jersey 
Craig, did you rsvp to that one crew party? 
Somewhat*
Why does that someone resemble my face 
I kid 
And a tiny peniz 
I didn't write those names and place the paper in his book bag or anything 
They aren't names I created, but I enlightened the group on all of Craig's boxing names I found on that piece of paper 
The gaf head was gold
Sam Ñ was Zach. I wish I could take credit for that 
So basically only names made up for myself

Make sure you truly love it because there is no going back

I would get inside bicep or ribs below the armpit kind of 
I love the outline of Ohio idea 
I would get it where no one would see it normally if I got one

@Craig Casto , are you taking notes? This genre of humor is dubbed "spontaneous unexpected". Made prominent by Peter Cerroli in his early comedy routines in the 1990s. It is a class of humor where the deliverer comes out of "left field", per say, with something completely spontaneous and unexpected, giving it the genre name of course. It is an important weapon in any man's arsenal who wishes to be perceived as "funny" by his peers

Makes sense. I support you regardless. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay 
That's what I was worried about. Being friends is fine but it's tough man. It really is. I can speak from experience and especially with things happening so soon. I just wanted to make sure you were alright and ready for that 
@Niel Skalican what's happening on the Lexi front? Friends on Facebook? Are you ready for that? Just want you to be okay, man :/
What do you expect with a crap squad. Two of your top three players injured. Don't even let him get to transfer window. 85 days. Bologna 
Blame bob Bradley for their shit squad and results. All of their fans are happy he is sacked and they finally get their guy and then a 4-nil ass kicking. I love it. 
I love Swansea getting smacked 
Well he probably won't be starting and will end up in USL so we will see 
Craig is getting that new abubakar jersey 
Even better. You're going to get laid 
Hot dog or leg
I will be in ada tomorrow morning :/
But he also has like the foot grips and rail and everything. He isn't skimming naked. He isn't natural like us

He is doing pop shovs off the wave

I would get a refund from the seller and buy a new one from classicfootballshirts.uk
@Zach Spangler @Brian Hoffman 
Only pc guys will understand. Sorry logan 
When you need a break from league/ark to go get more Red Bull and snacks. 
Crew schedule is out 
You won't have any weekends off?
They come out today 
Or was it 6
Was Toronto 8 hours? 
It's an 8.5 hour drive 
same. Mercedes benz stadium is going to me nice. 
That takes care of overnight stay too
I'd be down to do that 
All the trips above are the same distance driving wise to Toronto. Flying would be tough to work out but it's definitely doable. Of we fly we might as well go out west if we are spending that kinda money to fly 
Cheap red eye flights would be a possibility 
What would you wanna do then. Fly?
Chicago, NE, Philly, Atlanta, NY would be drivable 
I do plan on going to an away game
This summer but I don't think we can get out to Seattle on time 
Well
https://media3.giphy.com/media/ApmVMk6n1hxug/giphy.gif
Exactly. Like we know the worst case scenario and that's not to say it will happen. But I'm just being up front. It's not worth it. It's easier to set some sort of tone and not go overboard than to brush it off 
You're not saying you don't trust her but you're looking out for your relationship too  
Getting cheated on sucks 
I'd lay down the law 
That is sketch 
My relationship experience takes me out of the convo so i would listen to Niel more 
But she should understand that you care a lot about her and it's more about you not trusting him than you  or trusting her 
I don't thinks she is trying to make you jealous 
He has tried before and the fact you're on the other side of the country. That's nothing to mess with 
I would be super up front and serious about that 
Then just give them bactrim 
That is a fraction of pharmacy school

Steep throat? Bactrim
Bactrim cures all

Like I know you were in my house but I don't remember taking to you until the bar 
Bear paw slippers 
By the way, sorry for hanging you out to dry the night after my party. I was in a bad place. I don't even think we hung out after playing baseball, so I hope you enjoyed your time in Ada
They're too nice, man. I'm the same way 
Logan, I got new slippers so you can have my old ones back 
Work don't stop me

Thick sliced garlic bread came before thick sliced toast 
That originated from thick sliced garlic bread 
Specific garlic kind used to be all there was 
The plain thick bread came after the thick  read with garlic/butter/cheese
I'm right 
But it's not regular bread either 
Then some d bag wants to make French toast with Texas toast but doesn't want garlic on it, so he scrapes it all off and still calls the garlic less cheese bread "Texas toast" becasue it's a "bigger slice" and everything is bigger in Texas 
They originally made the bread thicker for Texas toast solemnly becasue butter and cheese was too heavy for the standard piece of bread, thus thickening it 
Garlic bread knows as Texas toast came before regular bread of the same side 
Note ingredients 
"Texas toast"

And the internet 
most companies have a history on their corporation if you go to their website 
It used to be solely garlic bread and then some bloke decides maybe we should use this size bread for something else, minus the garlic and cheese and he still kept the name 
Because it evolved from what original Texas toast was 
Are you stupid too? 
How am I wrong? 
Yep. Just Texas toast 
If I asked if you would like some Texas toast, what would that entail? What you expect to be getting 
my jersey for the exchange is in Chicago :) 
Mine was heavily not in favor of the use of risperidone as an antidepressant 
It was like a drug question and we had to search treatment guidelines and primary literature to validate or disprove the statement 
But I did get a 94 on my drug information paper on the therapeutic use of risperidone as an anti depressant.

There will be like 20 people for Nathan's party. The bar should be packed i would imagine 
The whole group would love for you to come up. I just don't want to disappoint you :(
I won't stop you lol. But it will be nothing like osu 
And you don't want to come to Ada lol
I'll talk to Nathan tomorrow and see what's actually going on 
If we even come down 😑 Nathan is wanting to stay up here now because everyone is throwing him a "going away banger"
ARE YOU HAPPY WATSON, ARE YOU?

It sounded better in my head I guess. I don't know. I'm spending my Friday night alone listening to Marvin's room. So there

Well, I don't know about that
He is trying and had the right idea. I applaud him for thinking of it. You will be funny one day craig

 Brian, you can pick that day 
I don't care what day either 
Tell nick to frig off and that you have other priorities 
If we wanted all of us. We would have to do after Christmas. Like 26 or the following weekend or something 
Logan won't get back until the evening of the 23rd
So you guys can make it whenever 
Craig and I leave the 23rd
Well that's good at least! 
😭😭😭

When does everyone get back 
I know I do 
And all of them are real jerseys too
Some are new, some are used but you can look at the condition of the jersey 
It looks cool though 😈
Whoever got me as a jersey. Prepare for the most random club ever 
They may not be this year but there are a lot of teams. You can get retro jerseys and even last years jerseys for 20 bucks 
Classicfootballshirts.co.uk has thousands of jerseys 
For those that haven't bought a jersey 
I just made suppositories for 3 hours. What's happening 
You mean taran
What are you doing up here?
Anyone wanna hang out 
You should of yelled at the security guard, "did you just assume my gender!?"
Did they escort you out? That really is douchey
So they didn't even let you use the bathroom either? 
Was security there the whole time or did they just show up once you got out? That really is unfortunate :( 
What did you do once you were thrown out 
Damn. 
Were there no other bathrooms by you? I've definitely been at that point. I just paid the guy in front five bucks to go in. Everyone hated me but I was relieved and didn't pee my pants 
I would've found a bottle and found a corner in a secluded area. That's ridiculous 
Why didn't the other guy get busted 
Were there any women in the restroom?
Wait.... are you serious 
What....
@Logan Patiño R u alive 
I'll be there at 7. Got off work early. But I have to leave still to get Nathan up to onu 
I work at 9am but I'm still down to hang 
Who will still be up 
Who will still be up 
I can be there at like 2am?
Skee skee
Needs to get back up to school tonight 
Well Nathan is being a diva 
I won't be able to make it :( 
Are we all still hanging out tomorrow? I work until 9 and then I have to pick Nathan up from the airport so I won't be there until 10ish. And logan, when do you leave for the osu game in the morning? Pretty early to get a parking spot I would imagine? 
A lot of them are getting busted 
Same. He is loving it there though. My baby was so shy the first few weeks in the states and  is he is taking on  NYC 
Nathan's snap in NYC today
Players at Bayern hated him. I'm sure  now that he is gone, players can say their feelings 
I was cool with keeping him as a technical director. But he is one terrible coach
Bad call ups 
New formation against your biggest rival. Subs in the Costa Rica game were stupid. Bad lineups 
He deserves to go a long time ago 
Embarrassed in the hex 
Lost to Guatemala 
Confed cup qualifier loss 
Gold cup loss

She is bae 
Wait until he shows you his model gf back home 
 Nathan and I  are going to mac on ladies. You guys are lame af
We don't have a PS4 ya dingbat
He likes regular. But I'll bring the sweet chili 
He loves FIFA, women, Doritos, and Malibu and coke
FIFA yes. Hot tubbing yes
Don't know about ping pong 
The foreigner 
Nathan Sars
Dutch Nathan 
Can Nathan come
You have to finish an inverted polynomial before you're allowed to pick up the controlled and play. First one done gets an advantage. That's what I would do 
He is in NYC right now 
I just have to see what he wants to do. I know he wants to go to osu to party and I have to work so I can't do that, so we will see what he does 
He loves FIFA
He can! Logan already has met him! 
Actually. I'm picking up a foreign exchange student from the airport and he is chilling with me all weekend :/
I work everyday except thanksgiving. It doesn't matter to me which day 
Do I really? Didn't you put it in your bag? I haven't cleaned out my trunk so if you left it, it will still be in there 
I've never been this furious at a soccer result in my life

You're welcome 
Jersey exchange. Don't forget it 
So is FC Dallas
There is so many interesting facets with this appointment. Although very scary 
@Niel Skalican Is the USSR coming back? If NATO dissolves and we become diplomatic with Russia, and Russia already evading Ukraine... what stops them from pushing forward. Especially with a ex KGB/commie Putin 
Well they have that in place in case uneducated voters mass vote someone they shouldn't. They meant well in the constitution. 

If the mass vote went to Trump and Hillary won the EC, the post would have been made by trump supporters and democrats would say this is why the rule is in the constitution. I think it's the constitution at least 
I see. Awesome. Thank you 
That's what I'm saying?  So it's not a gender thing. Hillary won the populous cities. Trump won the rural communities he promised jobs 
I just don't want to have that view if there actually is truth behind it. I'm trying to educate myself before I get labeled misogynistic and racist 
I'm not the best political person so I'm looking for an explanation because I don't know the answer. A lot of headlines are saying men ruined the election and we failed women. And I understand why based on the elected resident. But why are so many media outlets blaming white men? I'm not saying misogyny isn't real because it is. But the stats I've looked at show that the same amount of women voted republican as in recent presidential elections. I don't understand if the exit polls don't tell the big picture or if we are at fault. 
I'm equally scared don't get me wrong.  But I would be scared if Hillary was elected too. Just have to see what he's got now. And do research for the next election.
Should have been quotation marks starting at solely and ending at country. Those are not my views lol 
Eh. Republicans thought the world was going to end even a black president was elected solely do to skin color and not ability to manage a country. Trump will either be top 5 president in the history of the US or he will be impeached lol. No in between 
Money is everything 
Hopefully this changes our current political party system/ political system in general. I would have never guessed someone who had to cheat and illegally pave her way to get to her nomination, and someone has no political background would headline the ticket. It's crazy 
It will be an interesting four years 
I mean, it would be dangerous if democrats occupied all three as well. If there is no political party opposition, there isn't much coming from least represented side and they are going to have trouble implementing/fighting anything 
Is there going to be any political party opposition. HoR republican. President Republican. Senate republican. 
I start the 21
Are you out of town over the weekend? 
😂😂
We all tryna chill den?
And have nothing to live for now 
I'm crushed 
Are you not coming home :( 
What is everyone's thanksgiving break?
We are all friends again!!!

Funny you say that because that equation is a first order elimination rate equation for one compartment models so technically the baddddd could be eliminated given the right k, and t values 
She called me and was like please come over. I need to see you and I said I was with the boys making pizza and I'm about to go to bed and then she was like well I can just come over there and I stood her up again and then it was awkward. Like she was trying laugh it off. I'm sure she rarely has guys turn her away. This girl is cute don't get me wrong. But she is like baddddddd•e^(-k x t) . I can't do that 
But it was so awkward.
That's not true man lol
I can't do that 
I told her no  and she is definitely upset but there isn't anything I can do😑

That's what I'm saying. If those countries can't hold it with the current format, how is increasing it going to help 
How many stadiums do they have that's 100,000 plus seating 
They had to last time? 
Japan and Korea would have to share 
How is any South American nation supposed to do that 
How is Argentina any better than Brazil 
Okay. How many countries can hold the tournament then 
Housing wasn't even finished for majority of Olympic village 
Athletes were stuck in elevators 
The basketball team was on a cruise ship...
There are problems with majority of nations not having the infrastructure to host tournaments now, increasing the number two fold will only make it worse 
Host nations are going to have even more stress with more stadiums, lodging, policing, etc 
Make the rich richer. Take advantage of struggling economies 
This is just a ploy for money 
You had plenty of upsets and underdogs with the normal number 
CRC was an underdog 
Soccer
I agree with that, but that emphasizes qualification and always playing your best docent
You're not making it any more likely for bottom feeders to get it 
If you expand the tournament. Those teams for sure get in and you have really changed much 
Netherlands, Sweden, Portugal switch off making the World Cup. And that's always the story line 
That's what it is 
They're meaningless though. It only matters for like two teams in Europe 
Yes let a nation get beat by 16 plus goals over three games 
I don't want to watch Germany vs Gibraltar 
As they shouldn't 
Don't even start with that 
Gianni just wants to be famous and FIFA wants more money 
Look at the women's World Cup this year 
Qualification but that makes the qualification way less important and stressful 
You're going to dilute the tournament 
That is what makes the hex and what not so special 
Why have qualification then 
Hard pass
Top bins 
 Big goal for FCC!

@poonslayer I know you're probably stressed and incredibly busy, since I haven't heard from you lately. Just wanted to say you're an incredible person and you were meant for MIT. You're still the smartest guy I know and easiest of things were once difficult at one point in time. Don't get discouraged! 
Do or die for the crew 
He tried to say he has more composure than Hilary lol
She really was biting the bullet there. She has no room to talk about that and I would have thought she would have known that she can't bring up morality issues and secrecy and cover up in his tax return because she has the email scandal against her 
He simply just didn't know how to debate 
Exactly. All he could do was attack her personally it seemed like. He really lost me on a lot of his debate. Was pertaining to the question. His lack of political background really showed through 
She was really struggling towards the beginning. 
I didn't know why he was talking about half the stuff he was. Went off on tangents. At first I thought he was going to roast Hillary. The first thirty minutes I thought he was grilling her, but he started free falling from there 
Trump lost big time 
Never mind. On YouTube

I'm just saying. D.C. is the team we have to catch. And if we beat them next week, we are two points behind with a game in hand, with two games against the team last place in the eastern conference 
And we play D.C. next, a win putting us within two. Then we get Chicago back to back. We have a chance 
We are only five points out 
This would be the time we start putting wins together 
The good ol days. I miss you guys 
Look at all that muscle

Guys.. We are famous at onu 
I'm in class right now and here is a fun fact for you. Bayer (makers of aspirin) were looking for an analgesic to replace morphine because it was so addictive. They came up with two drugs, aspirin and heroin. They though aspirin was dangerous for the heart, so for 15 years, they marketed heroin as the top analgesic for teething babies, everyday pain etc. then people started dying and became more addicted to heroin then morphine. Bayer then switched to aspirin

Pretty insightful

I just hung out with Cara hardy 
Gave me one too
Sooooo Cara Hardy got a body 
Well we can't do trout club until 1:30. So that's off the table 
I guess I could 
I know! And only 12 bucks 
Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's the closest 
Where go you want to go? 
Look up the trout club in Newark 
Well I would all to find out the earliest tee times. They open at 7
@Niel Skalican 
Who all is in? I need to call to get a tee time and gave the number of people going 
Tim Tim Tim 
@poonslayer Preseason men's soccer rankings 
Golf*
Also. If we do the soccer good we need to reserve a tee time. So we need to decide as soon as possible so we can get an early tee time not in the middle of the day 
That works for me 
But honestly. You have to read it. I wish I was in book club so I could talk about it 
In the play, hermione is black. Which took me off guard 
So the new Harry Potter book is incredible..... 
Which is better than 18 the last time we played 
I called the trout club today. Foot golf would be 12 dollars a person if we wanted to do that Saturday 
I'm not even halfway to a charmeleon 
Only 6 candies though 😑
Just hatched a 480 charmander
I'm game. It's going to be packed Saturday lol

If you're playing soccer on those field and looking at the huge blown off Ohio state logo, we are to the right of that 
Niel. It is where we play soccer lol 
We are at the team bus 
We are at the team buses 
McCoy said south and that's final. I was overruled 
But our tickets are on the north side of the stadium 
McCoy said south 
Meet us on the side closest to campus 
Which is south 
It's the side we play soccer on 
Meet us at north side of stadium 
Library
Everyone but Brian and Logan 
Sweet. We are here waiting for you!
Where are you currently 
It will be like 630 when we get there 
Whenever you get here. We are getting our parking spot now and then we have to walk all the way to the stadium 
You and your dad are walking? That is a long walk my friend 
We could have picked you up!
Niel, traffic is absolutely horrid 
Where are you going to park 
@Niel Skalican When are you getting here 
Zach are you coming!?
We are on high street 
Going to the melt 
Misspelled bendtner jersey 
Hang around campus 
The melt 
About to leave 
@Niel Skalican I have your ticket by the way 
Okay 
Should I be at your house at 2?
Let's do it! 
I freaking love the melt 
I'm game. 
Okay let me know and we can go Pokemon hunt!
McCoy, when you wanna start chillin 
Ughhh. This game is going to suck 
WE GET TO SEE JAMES 
Let's! I can come over tomorrow moment after I work out 
I picked to catch them all!!!!
Lets hangout before the game 
McCoy, we hanging out tomorrow? 
Senior techs suck
With a thirty minute lunch break 
Just worked a 12.5 hour day 
Dig LIT af
Nice. The best thing I caught today was a 27 diglett
A kadabra! What CP?
If you send it to my gmail email can I claim it from the app? For future reference. Like I just claimed McCoys from the app but can't for yours 
That one is fine. I just have three emails. The one you use is my professional one and I rarely get on it. Plus I totally forgot about shades 
I'll claim it tonight. Sorry 
Logan what email did you sent the shades money 
I think it's 11 a person 
That's Canadian too
I just filled it out 
I'm pretty sure he is going 
We have to buy train passes during the week though. Do we want to go back into Toronto on Monday or no? 
It's an 8 hour drive, we should leave here at like 6am so that puts us at the campsite at 2. Hour to set up and take the train into Toronto and we should be good. 
So that saves stadium parking as wel and cuts down on gas
I talked to my grandparents. I guess traffic is always bad downtown and they advised taking the train into Toronto. They have a train that takes us directly to BMO field, and parking at the train station is free 
We have the campsite 
This is on the campsite website 
Actually, I tried to do a site with know electric and it's only ten dollars cheaper 
I say we don't get electric. We can wake up early and charge our phones at a coffee shop or something in the morning 
If we don't want electric on our campsite we can knock off 27 USD
So 11 dollars a person? 
With all the taxes and fees it is 55 usd
That's 44 Canadian by the way 
It's twenty minutes from the stadium 
Is 44 dollars ok for a campsite 
We are going to Toronto on the 31st correct? 
Sunday to Monday 
Yep
I'll get the campsite tonight or tomorrow! 
32 Americans or Looneys
I'm at work. If you guys want to order them then go for it. I can google wallet money to you guys

How do you have that many golbats
Egg?
Dangg I should've went. I need a hypno. I caught two abras though! 
I was 11 yesterday until I used a lucky egg. 
What level are you? 
That's freaking awesome!!!
I played at osu yesterday 
I wish. I work 10-3 here, then drive back and work 5-8 at Lancaster 
Driving now 
The Meijer in Fairfield OH 
I'll be close to UC for an intern meeting today!!

Trifecta of eevee evolutions 
Genius 
That is not fair. Why couldn't you be yellow!? 😩😩
I hope they make it like that. Otherwise you'll have to fight us 
This really makes me sad :( 
And we have to take it from you 
Now you have the Carroll post office 
Zach no!!
What....
Who is wearing a polo
530???
Let's do it. When you wanna golf 
I was getting off at 5. I was thinking okay ASAP and hit up the Latinos after 
What time is golf @Brian Hoffman 
I caught a haunter today. Squirtle is much better though 
This lady's car literally died in our pharmacy drive through. I'm in express dress clothes and had to PUSH her car out of the drive through into the parking lot.... It's it's so freaking hot 
Red, Blue, Yellow
What color team do you guys wanna join?
Anyone else level 5?
You can't run forever 
 It's up to you! I feel like it all depends on if we can get pokeballs easily without paying. If they are hard to get. Then maybe save pokeballs for Pokemon you will use
Yep! Or both! I'm sure you'll catch another. Or keep releasing one and keeping the better one if you want to evolve it 
Where do you find all these water Pokemon!!!?
I wish we could trade 
The squad
I have no idea what CP is. But if you want to evolve pidgy, keep the better one. If you don't want to, transfer both. (Release into the wild) and you get candy for it 
I can't believe I'm a gym leader 😍😍😍
I was hoping to have eevee evolve into flareon :( 
A GOLDEEN! I have seen zero water Pokemon 
I'm a gym leader :) 
I have three 
So for drowzee I need 50 
When you catch Pokemon and release them you get candy
Once you get enough of the basic pokemon candies you tap evolve 
 I JUST EVOLVED MY FIRST POKEMON
Embarrassed her pretty bad when they saw me walking in the park 
I literally was Pokemon hunting walking around the park in Carroll because there is three poke stops next to each other. I then see my sister and her friends at Shirky's so I got some pizza 
Catching hella Pokemon
Gotta be level 5. I'm 4! 
So we may be rivals 
For real. I'm def gonna be team yellow though 
Downtown Carroll

There is still a free gym open on ginder road 
Zach, are you a gym leader anywhere? 
Got an egg from the fire department 
How do you get eggs!?
Are we golfing/hanging out tomorrow? 
Embarrassing 
His little coffee bean is hanging out!!!😂😂😂

Zach do you have any gyms by you? 
So far it is. I have gone into Carroll yet 
You're so freaking lucky! There is one by the greenfield fire station for me. That's the closest so far 
I saw a venonat today though. Too strong to catch right now. I'll never stop trying! By mom! 
I HAVENT EVEN SEEN A ZUBAT! That Pokemon is rare in this neck of the woods 
Guys, Meijer is filled with pokemons.!!!!! Caught two evees!!
This could not be more true 😂
 I'll let you play before to decide to do it 
Wow. Can you guys go back...
This is incredible 😩

I'm starting to think you hate my grandpa, Brian 
Let's do it!
9-5
We will have to do weekday then 
Logan, I work the 23 
Our section is sold out unless you buy through stub hub. I think you can still get tickets through ticketmaster for a different section though 
@Brian Hoffman 
I could do 18 or 19. I don't know my day schedule but I know I have that weekend off
Christian Press in the ESPN body issue 😍😍😘😘
I'll look at my schedule 
KD went to golden state 
I am so angry 
Wow 
That is ridiculous 
That lives in Cleveland 
Other people being a member of the group chat 😉
I'm sure you could. You actually watch and pay attention to most big sports. Other people just became cavs fans three seconds ago 
Like you would be the perfect college roommate for me I feel like 
Well I was referring to the whole different schools thing primarily 
Niel, you're the best friend I've always wanted when it comes to sports knowledge. But you were/are never around. 
Mozgov's contract was whack too 
It's only because of the new salary cap but still 
Getting paid more than dame Lilliard 
You think KD leaves OKC?
I'm glued to the tv and Reddit  pages 
I know. I'm addicted to NBA free agency 
Very good convo. Soccer is lien the only thing I can fully argue in confidence. Everything else I don't know anything about 
I 100% plan on it 
Go to FCC and it's still under 100
Because you have ticket prices on top of parking fees. That's well over 150 for a family of four 
And the crew can't go anywhere else stadium wise. 
It literally generates little to no revenue 
The fairgrounds own the parking lot. We don't make parking fees 
We have the fourth cheapest tickets in the MLS 
Who on the crew roster is going to sell tickets outside of the avid fan 
European and Mexican teams aren't on a salary cap 
MLS payroll is significantly hire than USL. I wish the crew would drop their prices but maybe they can't afford to 
Crew had to build their own stadium 
I'm not saying they didn't. But you came in a time when people have done it before and you know where the pitfalls are 
They can't fix parking fees 
Crew stadium is outside of downtown off 71 
You have public transportation to games because you're downtown 
You pay free to 5$ 
To park.. I pay 15-20$ depending on the team 
I paid 400 bucks for season tickets in the corner/worst seats of the stadium 
And you know that 
I'm not arguing with you on attendance. That's stupid and not even comparable given the circumstances of both teams 
And then you get fans that want to support a team but the owner doesn't buy players.  If you never have good enough players for fear of going bankrupt and losing your team, you never get into MLS. And if you never try to get into MLS, fans don't support you. Why do you think some USL teams have little support? No MLS aspirations. I'm not saying FCC only has great attendance because of a chance of MLS, but the MLS idea allows for continued support 
I agree with that but we don't decide if there is pro/rel. the MLS is single entity. So all the owners have to agree on it. And all the owners invested millions/billions to play in MLS. They are making money of MLS. They won't vote for something that would eventually possibly run them out of business. 
Tv money is what makes leagues now a days. It rules the salary caps. Look at the NBA 
Where does the second division make money besides ticket and apparel sales 
There is no tv revenue for USL 
And owner has to pay upfront millions to get into the MLS and next year you make him play in USL? 
The only reason is financing 
I'm not saying that talent is the reason against pro rel. it literally is financing 
Players don't want to play in Columbus.... 
How many Americans outside of soccer now knows what pro rel is 
The crew is paying for Giovincos contract, Lampard, Pirlo, Howard, Higuain, 
We can't even afford the players we have now... The league splits up all dp contracts amongst all owners and teams because a team can't afford them by themselves 

Financially, the MLS cannot support pro/rel
You would lose the single entity which means everyone would have to find their own jersey sponsors... Teams that don't get jersey sponsors don't make money, don't buy players, don't sell tickets in a league that already struggles with attendance, the team then folds and soccer isn't s thing anymore 
But it's not about that. It's about the loss of investors when they realize that their team could go into obscurity as they slide into smaller divisions 
In all serious. I hope there is pro/rel. but now isn't the time 
I don't know. The same way probably a life time fan of the crew would switch to a new team and all of a sudden hate the boyhood club he was infatuated with 10 months ago 
Niel... You lost to a team in a division considered higher than USL that the third to last MLS team beat 5-0
Wow 
OLAAAAA

Better hope you don't see me on the playoffs. Im purposely getting fourth so I can knock you out first round. 
It should even count. Like you have no fantasy knowledge at all. If you didn't check the pre game lineup, it's your fault 
You won on a substitution. 
Logan, you're the gayest fantasy soccer player ever 
Help me. I'm stuck in my own body 
Wow creg
YASSSSSSSSS. I work this weekend but I'll still do it! 
Sleep over and volleyball ASAP

The final will be lit though

Great job, Yedlin 
Swag. I definitely want to come down soon 
In two weeks can I come down to UC? 
She has a huge crush on me, so my family always teases her about it 
Yes! Her name is Mikayla
Next year!!!! Everyone comes 
Wales!

And it was their third string goalie. We probably would have won 1 or 2 nothing if they had Navas
It was a good one. PK set the tone because we were getting murdered before that.
What about her friend 
We on 99.1 big stick!!!
She won't be there :( we are going two weeks early this year :( 
Come :(
Last night 
Where you guys at 
Even if we get out, we most likely go up against Brazil 
Must win game next 
😑
Did we score!? 
Or are we just pinned back the entire time 
Have we had any offense?
Klinsmann must be fired if we get last. No doubts 
ESPN picked us to be dead last in the group 
Do we even look decent 
What the hell is going on 
I need updates. In a car right now 
It's the 49ers
I'd rather see beckerman
Why 
JJ is starting 😩
What a skit 
Oh 
That's why we going for the crew game 
He scored on a header at the 18 lol 
Bald headed, doughnut packing, Hamburgler wanna be soccer player. 
He didn't. But he still sucks. 
We have an 18, a 19 year old in. Connor Casey is an idiot. Connor Casey sucks. Our whole team is on international duty. Philly doesn't have one player on international duty. Two own goals. These kits suck. 
2 OGs
After tonight 
Brian, they are a new team 
Niel, it's just banter. It's okay rooting for FCC. I just want to be hooligan. But I do get fired up at the Reddit boards 
Posers 
That's everyone at FCC. All of them were crew fans a year ago and now they hate the crew. 
And it's already a very heated rivalry between fan bases 
If FCC win tonight, they play the crew 
I'm not a fan of FCC. I hope they never win a title of any sort 
Crew>FCC
They have been knocking on the door all game though 
OG
No 
Go to the Tampa bay rowdies YouTube page 
You're welcome 
Free stream 
It's on YouTube homie 
Niel? You're not watching your beloved FCC? 
OLA!!!!
We gotta play when you get back 
It was really fun. Logan is a natural 
That's fine with me 
We would have to start at 7:30-8 at the latest though 
Same. I work at 11
I'm scared for when he plays us though 
Still hasn't scored for the revs
Good. Frig off kei 
No idea. It was towards the end of the game when we were trying to hold on. It was right in front of the nordecke. They started yelling at each other 
It was ridiculous. And Finlay and Higuain got into it towards the end of the game 
That game last night.... Kamara could have had like 6 goals and we almost gave it up 😩
The money 
But the payroll
I hate Real Madrid 
F that 
He hasn't dove once 
Atleti's keeper sucks 
Probably 
I want atleti
Madrid
Yes. He is an idiot 
What a loser 
Let's go barca
Fox
Porrrrrrr tiiiiiiii volllarrreeee
No one cares about this performance lol 
There is now crowd engagement 
Makes no sense 
Why is Alicia keys playing....
Anybody going to the crew game this weekend? 
https://media2.giphy.com/media/rT5vvlE6xFHIA/giphy.gif

Q. Who dat boi.

I am talking to a girl! First time in months!
I'm doing it guys!
You've been much wiser since returning from China. Those Chinese proverbs are doing you well 
I had to be a little tipsy to talk her but oh well. She finally came knocking 
Absolutely 
She twelve, Zach 
On the far right 
I'm already in love. Can she come to myrtle beach?
I'm going to marry her 
😍😍😍😍😍
SUPER ATTRACTIVE PHARMACY BABE IN MY DMs!!!!!!!!
What time? 
YESSSSS
Zach. We need tuh heroclick
How bad is it though. Honestly 
Ouch. That's unfortunate 
Did you drop the barbell on your back 
How
Level three calf contusion  over here. Suck it up 
I work 3-9
And we are right by the house 
Mel wants to see McCoy 
Can me an Mel stop by real quick, @Logan Patiño 
Toronto v CLB 
We going to the 6
July 
What's your point 
Check out the foot 
I'll sit in the pool while you guys finish the court if you want 
Passport is in the mail 
I am loving OKC rn
I'm turning passport stuff in tomorrow
It's the same crew from last time plus whoever wants to come 
Campus footy on Wednesday anyone? 
Largest payroll in the league, at home, in a baseball stadium, derby match, and you got waxed by 7 😂
I'm dying 
What the F. Nycfc is awful 
NYCFC lol 
Come over to Arsenal 
Sorry McCoy 
The man was nominated for team of the year in bundesliga as a midfielder. What are you doing 
And you're listing Fabian Johnson as a defender 
Timmy chandler and orozco are so bad 
What the F Jurgen 
Booooooo. SANTA FE! SANTA FE! SANTE FE! Santa Fe tiene mi corazon <3
I was getting some rules update and found a couple we didn't abide by and I didn't know if it was just we played backyard rules which is fine or if we just didn't know 
Because you have to spike or punch and it also helps the teammate not blocking because it limits the places where the spiked can hit it 
Basically eliminates David's dominance at the net. It actually makes it worth going up for a block 
I don't care if we play like we normally do, but technically there are a lot of illegal hits 
What rules or lack there of are we using for the volleyball tournament 
Go Brian. It's ya birthday 
https://media4.giphy.com/media/WYSWJvFbaT8n6/giphy.gif
First one
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,  BRIAN!!!
I just wrecked Craig in arm wrestling 
It's just weak sauce. Unless they anticipate it not selling out which I could imagine. If you only get 8000, it's easier to do at JO than at mapfre
But it's only 10k fans. Just do it at nippert then 
That's stupid. Only 10k....
If FCC wins, the game is at Jesse Owens stadium....
That was seriously awesome though. What a surprise 
Grade you those beats for the ability to play soccer tonight 
Logan, I'll be over there at like 5:30 with Robert 
Hopefully. I just need FCC to win 
We didn't even sell out the USA WCQ
I want Columbus to be a soccer city 
Cincy can bring just as many people if not more.... And we never do well on weekday games attendance wise 
Portland was much louder. PORTLAND. 
You were at MLS cup...
I hope. It would just be embarrassing if it were MLS cup all over again. Out chanted and out represented, or an empty stadium 
Yeah. That is lame af
Unless the crew lower ticket prices 
But again, it's crew fans. How many even know about this rivalry. And paying our ticket prices on a weekday. I would almost rather it be at UC
I would've went to UC as well. I just hope the Columbus faithful shows up 
Well I'd certainly hope so. But for fans to say it's unfair. If you offer to host (which I highly assume you would). It comes down to a coin flip 
The us open cup will be middle of the week again if they play the crew 
I mean, you had a 50/50 chance 
All 8000
FCC crying on Reddit because they don't get to host the game 
Yeeeeeeet
I need a girlfriend 
Incredible 
That's pretty cool. We saw that this morning 
Your attendance was 8000 tonight
Niel, you going to FC cincy game tonight?
Pooty
Ohhhh. It's Brian's?
I think I'm going to stop by target because they have the expansion for twenty bucks 
Catan? 
Heroclix? 
You got it boi 
Just volleyball tomorrow *
Is a sleepover on the docket tonight or just tomorrow 
Touché 
It's not your birthday 
Well I don't work Wednesday and I get off at 4 today 
We tryna chill this week or no?
Niel, how often do you and Lexi go hiking? 
Just for the friendly 
It's not the copa roster. Puerto Rico sucks. He just called up a bunch of fringe players 
WHY COULDNT ADI PULL UP WITH A HAMSTRING 4 MIN EARLIER 
Ur still gay. so I win 
Welp. Good game Logan 
Is it not a thing? 
If anyone has events to add. Let me know. It's cool being the historian 
Well that might be. I didn't think it was but it could be wrong . I don't really. know. I just get the best grades I can. 
Once you fail three classes I think you fail or or you're on probation. I think below a 2.5 you also get on probation 
I think as long as you have a 3.0 and haven't failed three classes 
They can trade discovery right 
Yep. Third place 
You've never seen Tottenham finish above Arsenal. You haven't been alive when Tottenham finished above Arsenal 
21 years, Brian 
TOTTENHAM!
Shit!!!!!
Lololololololololol 
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dank
You sold your soul to Mother Earth. You're becoming earth where you'll be stuck forever 
That's crazy. I could not do that 
And what was your time
How long was the race? 
That's pretty cool.
You left her behind!? 
Does she still hate me
I'll definitely come down for another his summer!
Go 2 sleep little zākî
Zach, how was China?
Niel, thanks again for yesterday!! I really had an awesome time. We have to do that again
We need a win badly. 
We have nowhere to stay. Plus we don't have clothes 
Today probably 
Yeah. We at the game 
You got the jerseys? 
GUYS. BENDTNER IS WITHOUT A CONTRACT
Sure 
I get off work at nine. We can leave to Niel's straight from your Casa
Sleepover tonight? 
Please baby no more parties in LA
No more parties in LA 
I saw that this morning. New rule allowing a fourth DP because MLS 
I can either wear Craig's goalie jersey or an ONU sweatshirt 
Wear the Drogba!
I'm ready 
Neither do I. Just look up kei Kamara Twitter 
Kei is acting like a child on Twitter 
We scored five against dC without him lol 
He gets the ball to the wingers which gets it into kei 
Higuain doesn't score because he isn't supposed to in greggs system 
I'm happy we got rid of him. We just need to make it to July. That's it 
Look at all the talent on the Houston rockets. Bad locker room. Bad team 
We weren't one with him and he ruined a locker room 
Take away Montreal and he has done nothing 
Our team isn't even a playoff team 
I know Middlesbrough hated him 
Nate Johnson 
We got rid of him originally because of his attitude, Johnson said 
I hope he falls flat on his face in NE 
Oh wow. That's awesome 
The deal doesn't say anything about a pick but they might not have disclosed it 
Revs offered us the most 
I seriously hate him. What an arrogant a hole 
Falcao to crew summer transfer window 
Oh my gosh. 
Wow.
That's so weird 
Are you serious!???
Noon?
Plus u 
We need one more. It's me, Logan, and McCoy 
What time are we allowed to get there 
Did you get us Bailey tickets 
Oh. I thought it was at 730
Come down Saturday and leave Saturday after the game 
Yeah 
At your place? 
Well it depends if we have a place to stay... I can stay all weekend if you want. It's up to you 
What shall I bring? 
Am i good to come over right after work? 
Well I was super sick Saturday. Sunday I was out with family all day. And I worked today from 1-9 and tomorrow 8-4
I've been home since Saturday 
@Niel Skalican Are we going to be able to get tickets? You already have passed 10k tickets sold for Saturday....
I have Wednesday off work 
PLEAASSEE
Sleepover tomorrow!!?????
I'm off Wednesday!
Craig sux at spikeball 
For sure. Let's plan for that one then 
Dang it. Well that sucks 😔
I really want to go to an away game this summer and our only options are Toronto, Chicago, and philly I think 
I am 100% in.
I have to renew mine as well. So let's get that sent in this week and do it 
Do you have a passport!? I'm in 
We gots the spike ball
Like what the actual hell was that 
Oh my gosh....

What did you do for the other 29 minutes and 50 seconds then 
Well people think you're good probably
Are there a lot of NBA fans over there? 
What time is it over there 
Fair enough 
You think you're better than me??!!
What's that mean 
No longer being a lurker
And he wants to go to more crew games 
Logan, for whatever reason, Donnie thinks your like awesome... And wants to hang out when I come to Cleveland for the cavs game 
It's settled then 
So there will only be four in the car. The person riding with my uncle still chips in for gas of the car we take 
Yeah. But on the way down, me or Craig will ride with an uncle and the opposite on the way up 
Does anyone going to myrtle beach want to volunteer a car and not pay for gas? 
Torres and Muller with the cold turkey PK 
This Bayern game is a good one 
I watched that last night. Really really good
I didn't think you could scum lower than Diego Costa, but congratulations Tottenham. 
How did rocket league go 
$48
Yeah. Whenever you get the money. Doesn't have to be today 
Have you seen any cats yet....
You check out ali express yet?
You're Zach from the future 
How is yesterday? 
88 minute goal. Sweet
Just watched a couple by two bottles of lube and at one point they looked over and saw me staring at them. Very professional 
My worst enemy will have his hands rendered useless forever 
The real kind.... That locks your fingers forever 
They suck. Zach, buy me one of those Chinese finger traps 
Update? 
Bring home the rocket league trophy 
Po hang steelers!
The witch is dead. Get a chungham Dragons jersey

Ohhh I misread your last message 
How many free tickets? 
You only get a week of PLT...
It's less busy during the week! If we could all just ask for a day off we could do that 
Wow! I've been getting chubby. I need to do whatever you're doing 
You lose some you win some. As long as the outcome is income 
I have finals next week
Them and india don't care about pollution 
Don't die. Their air sucks. 
I'm 100% in for that too 
As long as I don't get this new job and they don't need me that weekend 
I'm 100% in 
I'm not doing anything either 
Well frig off then

Broad shoulders by Taylor Bennett and chance.... Do yourself a favor and listen to it 
Sweet. Those are a myrtle beach essential 
Next free time you have, will you check and see if my black Hurley phantoms are at your house? 
He doesn't need it until the next home game and I come home Friday for work 
I'll get it Friday 
@Logan Patiño Do you still have Robert's ticket card or did I misplace it? 
I don't think it really looks that good 
F saido mane
You sure? That's fine with me!
Sweet. I can pick you up at Julie's and we can head on over 
By the way, Logan we are planning to be at the melt at 5, is that still good? 
This is crazy 
PULISIC STARTS AND SCORES AGAIN
I just dropped this sick rap on #Rapchat. I call it 'Chuck Dis Track' listen here: https://rapchat.me/share-rap.html?rapid=E07B1BC0-08EB-11E6-BE8A-836687D98ED9
I've gotten two today 
People at ONU are literally making dis tracks about me on rap chat 
Gotcha. If I can, do you want me to add you to the wait list? 
Ohhhhh. I could ask her 
You wouldn't buy them through me. I can have my season ticket rep call you if you want. I can give her the low down and you can talk about things. She is cool, pretty young. 
For the crew I presume? 
Cold turkey grammar 
Finale*
Daredevil season finally has me crying 
It's 9:10 in the morning, having breakfast and its da COL TURkEE?
That doesn't make you not cold turkey though
Craig, you cold turkey with that grammar 
It's still sooooo bad 
He has it bumping on his bose speaker 
Donnie was crying as well 
I have no idea if you can download it
I LOVE YOU FANS
I'm struggling to get studio time 
I just dropped this sick rap on #Rapchat. I call it 'Cold Turkey' listen here: https://rapchat.me/share-rap.html?rapid=B197EF20-0802-11E6-B90B-0F78E83E5490
Please give me a listen

Absolutely! Please do come 
The grilled cheese place 
Yes
Oh
You work a 16 hour day....
You can come too if you want 
Logan, for the game Saturday, I'm bring Donnie and I'm meeting another pharmacy friend from ONU at the melt on campus. Me and Donnie are going to explore Lancaster and then go to osu to explore and then the melt. If you want food that's where we will be. If not, I'll pick you up at Julie's 
This is something Zach would say 
 Pulisic named to bundesliga totw!
Is that dude a level 2 dragon priest or something? Weak AF
Massachusetts institute of terrorism 
Autocorrect 
Stanford bridge is falling down 
To sit the bench 
Nope.  I'm cool with going straight there
Are you gonna want to eat before the game again or are you going to be good 
Sweetness
So 127 for both 
107
Want me to pick you up at Julie's again so you can park for free? I have a parking pass 
Yee
You still wanna go to the crew game? 
Green got me lit af
I can't believe Craig has the second most points in fantasy but is second to last 
Team pharmacy 
Goog wall it 
Yeah. Like you get one point 
That's why you need a bench 
You literally needed one more point to be doubled to tie 
are you serious 
They are struggling 
Barca lost again 
https://media1.giphy.com/media/kyH070AOWdrYk/giphy.gif
I'm definitely thinking my family is getting it so we will bring it to the beach 
It's 2v2 beach extreme volleyball 
Look it up bro bro 
Prepare to be dominated 
Spikeball for myrtle beach this year: ✅
Copping that USA jersey rn
Pulisic scored for Dortmund!
Crazy stuff. I hope if Lester wins, all the players don't move on to big money clubs. It's nice to see a change of pace 
Anybody watch that Leicester game 
What's a goal 
To slay the giant 
I will step up to the task 
We needed you 
😩
BRIAN 😊
Like they were under all these folders. Under a locked filing cabinet she only has the key for 
THIS LADY PUT THEM IN THE BOTTOM OF THE FILING CABINET!!!
The ticket for you to buy is next weekend agains Houston 
The game is next weekend 
I could give it to Julie tonight actually 
Craig wants to lower his car and get windows tinted and a new muffler. Wants to be one of those racing cars. And I don't care. You want to pick it up at the game? Or earlier 
And yep. I'm picking it up tonight. 
RIVERSIDE CUP DERBY ZACH 
Brian, my pharmacist got in a huge fight because he found out this guy (who has stolen from the store before and now can only come through T the drive through to pick up his rx)  was selling his test strips on eBay 😂 and now he is turning him in for Medicare fraud 
They are 5 dollar tickets 
They are playing their rival 
Are you going to the game!!?
Gai. Have fun boi 
No just what are you doing tonight 
Logan what are you doing 
I can't play tomorrow. I have to get stuff done unfortunately. I have a big week coming up 
Yeah. I got work Saturday plus the crew game so I can come down Friday and play 
I can play Friday? 
I wish I stayed up and watched that. That is awesome 
Well they will get subbed out then 
Currenthiphop isn't even a website anymore 
How did Good Friday not make it on my beautiful dark twisted family 
Logan, that was freshman year. I remember singing that at the Lancaster scrimmage 
WHATEVER YOU WANT 
I found a flash drive with all my old music. Oh my gosh 
July by drake and jhene aiko
What a song 
Wow 
I just listened to dreams money could buy for the first time in at least three years 
In comparison to city? 
It works though 
I do hate atletis style of play though lol. Just foul as much as you can to play the slowest pace of football 
Man city are only underdogs because they have never made they semis. They have better talent than atleti for sure. 
They're the underdogs 
https://media1.giphy.com/media/LAUrMGIMl4SoE/giphy.gif
Atleti
You knew that 
Arsenal 
I will never root for them in anything 
I still hate city 
I was pulling for benfica but now I want atleti
Ew
Show what..?
.... 
What is happening to barca? Dropped four of 5 in all competitions!
That's pretty sweet! Didn't you not want to be in that at all though? Or just not be president? 
I would be there if the crew had an away game :/ 
Are you going this weekend? 
And Shaun Okoli had a sweet scissor kick for the opening goal 
14,000.....
We have a chance to! 
That really is a beautiful picture. I love nippert 
And it's a big rivalry game this weekend 
Niel did you see how many people were at the home opener??
He scalps tickets 
Well let me know. I'm only extending it to you guys. If not, I will sell it to big Rick in the parking lot 
I'm selling it for a friend 
I have an extra nordecke ticket for the April 23rd game. 20 bucks if you want to come with me and watch some crew soccer together 
Ware du ppl get deez power puff girl pics at?
Creg, you dating that girl yet? 
For a month?
When does summer class start?
Well I'm guessing Craig will use my old set, so we have one extra set 
I have two extra sets of clubs since I got new ones for my birthday last year 
Pleasant valley!!
How do I think I'm better than you 
I can't do either of those 
If I can get my shin splints under control 
I absolutely would but I seriously can't get rid of these shin splints 
No one is capable of running s marathon 
Plus we have to transport clubs down 
But it's not like pleasant valley.  Like you have to be able to hit a driver straight which no one could do 
Although it would be easy to find. SC is the largest populated golf area in the US
No one knows how to golf...
Did Yedlin do okay 
Dare me to drive 
I jus drank a fifth of vodka 
Plus I've been at work all day 
How often do you see that in sports unfortunately 😔 break out year, the guy gets paid, then he struggles 
Giving Kamara that DP deal 😩 I need some production homie
Take it off the ticket price for the PSG game 
How much do I owe you 
When does my gainz fertilizer come in 
That's disappointing 
Bro. I would have to start training now and find a way to get rid of these shin splints 
Six four-minute rounds of jump rope

It gets so much more complex 
Do they have the expansions? 
I literally play Catan every Friday lol 
Like.. Newb
The only man I know that takes ten minutes just to decide he is taking his tokens off of a pushed character 
Well if you wouldn't take so long, Logan....
Well that gives us like 15 minutes of hanging out then!? 
We also need to decide if someone would like to volunteer the car for the trip and that would of course mean they don't pay gas 
@Logan Patiño I come home tomorrow for work. We chillin or nah? 
If you want to google wallet, I can give you the email. Or we can do it in person. Whatever is easier 
For the myrtle beachers: condo needs paid for by May fourth according to my mom. So start working on that moolah
Yes! Pharma companies make the big bucks and set the prices. I would think you would get laid well! And we can talk drugs and exclude Logan and McCoy! 
Teva is a generic manufacturing company 
Absolutely! Yeah I would say they are a pretty reputable company 
Like one of the biggest 
I mean, they are a pretty big pharma company 
Ye
Why do you get to do this!? I want to do it 
Wow. That's cray 
PharmD or intern? 
My team just sucks 
It really was an ugly week 
Logan beat me on a caption pick last week and Brian this week 
I suck at captain picks 
Brian, those were great team goals and Payet is a beast
Zach that is hilarious 😂😂😂
Craig, loftys-cheek scored 
I want to say so much to encourage you to watch it but I could never spoil it 
I don't remember the first twenty minutes because so much has happened since then 
You definitely need to give it another chance 
2nd season is great 
You need to let me know when you finish it so we can talk about it 
Niel, this show is incredible 
Oh my gosh. You are in for SO many twists 
Everyone, please do yourself a favor and watch daredevil.
Ironic 
Is that supposed to be iron because of your profile pic 
Trailer park boys reference 
It's badminton 
And we rarely get to use it in the winter because the basketball team needs all three gyms to practice for 22 guys 
So for the third week in a row, open gym is cancelled 
BAGMITTON !????????
I mean. It's open gym. Friday at 6. Always is. And it always gets cancelled because we only have three basketball courts and there is a BAGMITTON TOURNAMENT 
ONU sucks 
Public service announcement 
I'm dying at every post. This is the best trolling I've ever seen 
Everyone that uses Reddit. Go to the Ken M subreddit. It is freaking hilarious 
No, why?

It would be 7 or 730
It sucks that that is the case but come one now. 
No one watches women's soccer besides the World Cup. There is no more money to give them 
20
I saw. I don't know how much merit it has though 
Sweet. I will order them after class
So he is in!
But definitely by April fourth 
Presale ends in four days so the sooner the better. I would like to order at noon at the latest 
How long does he need 
What soccer team is Ecclesiastes anyways. Chile Serie A?
@Craig Casto Who dis chick? She bout to get her request deleted. You at least gotta be an 8 to be my Facebook friend 
I have 4 grand saved to my name. That's it
https://media3.giphy.com/media/UrXMuRyPBKhOw/giphy.gif
I would do it all just to make sure it is right then give him 0 percent on participation 
I hate group projects 
Rekked
Sounds good to me 
I can wait to buy them. I'm still waiting in Craig to see if he wants to go 
When will Curtis know? 
My bank thanks you 
God bless 
Whatever works for you 
nicholas_casto@yahoo.com
It will be 48 bucks a ticket with the charges included 
I will order them at 3pm today. Everyone think about it and get back to me. I'm buying tickets for:

Niel
Craig
Brian
Logan
McCoy 
So I guess tickets would actually be 48 bucks after fees
I'm ordering 6 tickets 
So it's going to be 300 bucks. How fast can everyone get me money 😁
We in C deck row 30.... Is that okay with everyone?
35 bucks 
Who wants a ticket to PSG v Madrid 
Are you serious...
We on the ultralight beam 
YEEEET
Score?
That sucks B
Damn :/ 
He really did. Was Finlay offside? 
A Wednesday 
July 27
Well that was the plan since I won't see anyone between today and tomorrow 
Let me know, I order tomorrow 
Cheapest is 35 bucks and next jump is 70. I'm thinking we all do 35?
I can get up to twenty tickets for PSG and Madrid 
I'll leave in an hour so be ready hombre 
When will you be done again? 
Do you want to get food or am I eating on the way down 
Logan where do you want me to pick you up at? 
I'll let you know the price and then everyone can tell me if they want me to get them a ticket or not. Then we all will
Be together 
I'm pumped. Also, I get pre sale on the ICC game and I think it said I get to order go to twenty tickets 
I'm leaving here at two. So that works for me 
When are you done with classes?
And I would seriously murder Klinsmann 
I would seriously cry 
I know.... I would cry tomorrow 
If we lose and Trinidad and Tobago wins against st Vincent and Barbados... Neither Guatemala or T and T have to win a game to eliminate the US :/

We can't have McCoy win everything 
Brian you need another late season charge in epl
He got 3 last week 
And my two wins came against Craig and Niel 
I have the least amount of points 
I hate my team tbh
I forgot about the dbl game week
Giovinco
Tough match ups 
Look how many points Craig has and he has no points lol 
Grandma also is awake 
Craig. Door is unlocked 
I'm last man standing and I was going to bed 
Okay. Good thing you texted me 
Yeah 
The last lose to Guatemala 

1988
We are third in the group.... And we haven't even got to the hex yet 
The team is garbage. I can't wait to hear his press conference 
That XI was garbage 
He seriously is an idiot 
I'm done with Klinsmann 
Like what the he'll 
What a miss 
GUATEMALA 
Guatemala.....
This is so bad 
Is anyone watching?
You gotta bury that 
Ale please.....

2-0 Guatemala 
Terrible defending on the corner 
He used to be so in form 
Mix diskerud is trash 
Guatemala is dominating this game 
1-0 in the sixth minute 
But it's in español 
I got a YouTube stream and it's crystal clear 
Diskerud...Castillo....orozco starting???????
Yet we can't fill up mapfre stadium for a WCQ
40,000 went 
25,000 stadium 
Is it an important game or are they revolting 
Why 
Nope 
Well okay then. If you're cool with that then that's what we will do 
You sure 50 is okay for you? Pay what you want, buddy 
I'm leaving class at 2, so I'll be there around 4ish. We can grab food and hit the game if you want 
What works best for you. I know Nathan wanted me to get there a little early to hang out and tailgate a little bit I don't really care where we go. We are in the American outlaws section with him and Robert 
Uhm can you park at osu and I pick you up there and we split parking? I'm going back to school after the game
Back to you Logan. If you want it you can have it. 
Cincinnati is a front runner to get into the MLS!!
Well you two figure it out. It's Tuesday night 
😂😂harsh 
If you really want to pay me for it. Whatever you feel like paying is what I'll give it to you for 
Well you're not going to want to pay what I payed for it and I'm not going to be able to sell it for what I payed for it 
It was bought on accident because I didn't know what I was doing 
It's a long story. 
If you want it 
1-1 on a pk 
Like its free. 
If anyone wants a ticket to the wcq on Tuesday let me know. It's yours to have 
Okay 
It's cool. You can have it 
Are you going to the USA game Craig or no 
And why is it my song? The oxy contin? 
Thanks Craig 
United States have 20 percent possession

Not very good 
Well I need Kansas to lose or I'm torched 
How quickly you all forget 
I thought no one cared about that trophy 
Why does everyone all of a sudden care about march madness 
I look at the u23 roster and j question how we are in this playoff. Sooooo much talent on that roster 
Both are away games aren't they? 
Nationals 
1-1 for the baby mationales
1-0 USA 
ITS GAMEDAY FOR THE US AND BABY NATS

Wtf Columbus 
I gots to work :(
Why did he not just lay it up...
Niel
Make it 7
  I'm getting there around 6:30
Sounds good to me 
What time you wanna do dis
Sweet 
Welp
Can we get pizza 
If yours want your sexy time then that's cool too 
Well I'll come to just watch basketball if that's cool 
And weed 
I'll buy the liquor 
House party 
That works for me 
That would be a travesty 
That'll be tough without Tate 
I don't have much faith though. The team really is pretty bad 
I don't even know who we play 
We were a new team. We are going to win the NIT!
Bad loss in the first game of the season 
Cincinnati would have been second to last in the big ten. Don't go boasting yet, Niel 
Says the almost Michigan attendee 
Orangemen 
I think it's z dank 
What does the reporter expect him to say. How did Yale score more points than you 
To be fair. He kept Baylor in the game 
Are we doing cedar point this year as well? 
Logan will be in CLE
Why not.
Sure. I'll be out of school then 
You got it bro bro 
But I can sell my ticket and come down 
I try to go to every home game (darker shaded) 
There is my schedule 
I work this weekend. I told you I would come down when I have s free weekend 
Logan when can I come over? Heroclix? 
You guys have been pretty hard on me lately 
Thanks Niel 
I won last year as well
I've won March madness every year we have done it 
I win championships 
No it's not :/
Literally had my blood boiling 
Yes I have. Did you guys see the duke lacrosse one!!? The best one yet....
Why is everyone being mean to me in this chat all of a sudden 
You guys are gay! 
Give me credit 
I made the Yale pick too....
Just face timed Craig. Don't try to do it past 10pm. He is a cranky man 
Elite 8
Logan you wanna chill tomorrow. I work this weekend 
Well that Purdue game really really hurt 
Zach lets hang out tomorrow, Logan is not invited 
And I must have clicked the wrong button when I was making my ESPN one 
I'm so pissed. In my dads work bracket that I win every year, I had Iowa st winning 
Craig I have no idea. You would have to get Logan to answer that 
Feel it 
🔥🔥🔥🔥 burn, Craig 
When is your mom open at osu 
Wanna chill when you get back? 
Brian, I've missed you. Tell Emily I want you back in my life 
Z swag. You coming back home for spring break?

Thanks anyways! 
It's over
Niel, any updates on the phone or email contact 
And the game starts a 345. Daylight savings B-ri 
Okay. Never mind then 
Our team is looking for other teams to play 
Brian, does Toledo have a men's club team 
I'm the only guy wearing an Arsenal jersey and I've seen 3 different barca kits today 
I'd be okay with that 
I don't see a better coach. Not than man united are a poor team but look at their coaches after Ferguson 
Right now, no 
I was a month ago with pep looking to come to the epl 
And they get red cards because maybe a lack of discipline from the coaching 
The coach has a role in bringing players in...
In all fairness with the money they have, how can't they be a consistent top finisher. Don't get me wrong he is a great coach. But no one plays to be a top finisher year in and year out. Great accomplishment, great coach 
We needed pep. He understands our style 
Only because I don't think there is an upgrade out there yet 
Uhm no 
I think the FO is worried about a manU situation 
Probably not 
I'm really nervous it will get ugly 
Arsenal will throw everything at Barcelona and the flood gates will open 
 Now isn't a good game to watch.
I'm onto you guys 
You guys jumped on the stats train two weeks ago without watching the game 
Barcelona will posses in their defensive have, skew the stats, hit Arsenal on the counter 
Not me 
Cat was her name. I don't like her music as much though :/ but she still has an incredible set of pipes

Why are the playing at Yankee stadium still. This is so bad.

Wow. Good work Nielsen!
Does Brian have his whole team ?
I just ordered one the other day 
No I had work. I sold my ticket 
The crew...
I be working at the pharmacy all day. Happy birthday Dank Daddy Kush 
🔥🔥🔥 feel the bern, Craig. Feel it 🔥🔥🔥
Was standing up the punishment for losing? 
Are you chasing down any more offers? 
I'm sorry man 😔
Wow... That is a total dick move 
https://media1.giphy.com/media/inVvfuomoD31K/giphy.gif
Otherwise I would love to come down 
I really wanna get down there 
 I work this weekend and next weekend 😔
We used to be really good. This year we are awful 
It would just be cool to get smashed and then chill afterwards lol 
Nope 
But thanks for the offer 
Nah. I don't want to play you guys then 
Niel, are you still on the UC club team? Our team is looking for teams to play this spring 
They have sweet retro Suns jerseys too. I also bought about a Reggie Miller pacers jersey 
No. He is a cavs fan. Just liked the supersonics because of the name and colors 
Donnie loves the supersonics and Shawn kemp lol. He always uses him when we play NBA jam so I got him one for his birthday 
I rep the 6 for Aubrey 
I was deciding between Iverson, mutumbo, Wilkins, drexler, tmac, and chamberlain/Johnson. All have sweet retro jerseys. But k liked the raptors the most 
Niel, I will get you the t Mac one and we can be 1 and 2 
I got a Kyrie Irving one too 
This jersey was 10 dollars no lie 
Already showed dad. He said he is still one of my favorite jerseys

She tryna tell me she don't have no feelings. 
That's what I'm saying 
But I ain't gonna do it 
It's super tempting 
College athlete too
She has a body 
It just came out of left field 
She got a boooty
She isn't hot but she is attractive 
What is going on 
This girl in my pharmacy class wants to be FWBs
We all go down together 
I work that weekend too :( do t go that one 
Captain 
I got burned on the caption pick. Frig off McCoy 
Granted this is only the first game and it's much easier to come back in this format than an epl 
I don't know how you get last every season 
Niel, how do you pick your team 
I love it 
Cool. 
Where are you? 
That is the best gif I have ever seen 
La bicicleta
WHHHHAAAAA
Ughh. Why 
Why is Higuain not wearing the blacked out copas!?
Hopefully Nguyen or Nagbe can fill a cam role and Bradley can drop back and be secondary but still be a defensive presence 
I agree. But unfortunately he is our best playmaker, so he gets played out of position 
Everyone criticizes Bradley for not producing in the CAM but it's because he tracks back to help out our dmids so often. Michael Bradley is a play maker, but he doesn't just sit at midfield and collect and distribute. He can't play like a true CAM/playmaker because of everything he does defensively 
He played CAM all World Cup yet tracked back to cover JJ, who has no tactical/positional awareness at all 
Like he is the most tactically smart player we have 
Then who would be 
He literally is the general of our midfield. 
I mean what player do we have that can do that 
https://m.soundcloud.com/ehealy/150-roll-widdit
Who would you put in his spot. 
Because I find him to be a pretty important piece in our line up 
I will forever be a Michael Bradley advocate 
Look how many touches he fields compared to everyone else 
Everything runs through Michael Bradley 
Why does everyone hate Bradley.....
Top three in the conference or league? 
We aren't the only good team though. This is MLS, a league built so that the same team doesn't win every single year. We should expect to make it to the cup but it isn't like we are entitled to it. A lot of teams got really good 
Well they are doing the ring, banner, pre match celebration/honoring so we should be ticked 
Bear cans are a little aggressive don't you think? 
I only said that scoreline because we are away team. I definitely think with villafaña gone, Finlay will have a much better game 
How did palace lose that game 
I second McCoy's predictions 
I also love the team name, Niel. New season, new Niel 
Logan, your team name is incredible!!!!
If he signs up 
I thought mine was decent. I hope no one has used it before 
Good team. I wouldn't want to face you week one

I looked at your roster this morning and I was very optimistic about gaining more ground. Touché my friend. Touché

Good job, Brian. 
Grammar extraordinaire 
If anyone has a a benji to spend and wants to go to a WCQ or knows anyone that wants to go. Let me know 
Shut up, Brian 
Champions league 
And Colombian pace 
What a free kick by Dempsey 
I don't know. The whole first half barca didn't really attack. They were just passing it in their half to tire out Arsenal for the second half. It worked. Arsenal was playing more direct. 
At the end of the game, fox sports had the shots like 8-9 in favor of Barcelona and the had 2 more shots on goal 
You guys didn't even watch the game...
They had more chances than Barcelona, honestly 
Arsenal just dicked around with the ball in Barcelona's half. Literally we got the ball on the touch line, went all the way back to midfield get countered on 
Anybody watching this game? 
Ramsey is playing soooo badly. 
jfc chamberlain. Put that away😩
Arsenal doing okay so far
If the email isn't working just go to find private league and put in the code: 381-422
How about now 
Did you get the emails? 
We lost our final for game by three in overtime 😔
It's now names Logan's league to avoid confusion 
Yeah 
Your house? 
Are you staying on campus McCoy? 
Really? 
Who is living in Columbus this summer 
League name: Clevelancastinati

Anyone know anyone that would like to play? 
Are we just doing the normal squad? 
Is that ya boo's email? She can play if she wants. I have no problem getting an extra three points when I play her

 Brazil has such an easy group. Arg vs chile will be cool to watch 
We need optimism! 
I love how Reddit already asked if we don't get out of the group do we fire Klinsmann 
Only because we were the host. The second pot was the next highest ranked conmebol. The third was remaining concacaf and fourth was remain in conmebol. I think that was the break down 
Yep. 
But we aren't that good. Talent wise we shouldn't have even been in the first pot 
It is one of the hardest groups. Tough draw 
I was sarcasm 
Easy group 
are you getting an Xbox one? 
Dude my car I use like Fred flinstone. Got calluses on my feet from braking to holler at the babes. Why all these young kids getting nice whips?

So we in the elite 8. We play the football team who are just complete trash. Like lowering shoulders on screens. Running through us on our screens (we are 6 white scrawny pharmacy kids). They literally elbow our best player with a minute left and his lip was sooo bloody. Then they tried to pick a fight with this one kid because their player grabbed his shirt and threw him down by his collar because they needed to foul so we would shoot free throws. So I get in their face and start saying choice words. Fast forward to 3 seconds left and we are up by two and I'm at the line. I drain the first free throw. I kid you not, I look this kid in the eyes and say you wanna start something? He said "what the f** you say pussy?" And I said I'll see you next year then and I granny shot this free throw and hit nothing but nylon and then shit hit the fan.

Fair enough 
But you don't get all four seasons
Smokies 
Tennessee Niel 
If you go to the mountains you're a long drive from the beach 
You get all four seasons 
You want mountains, your 5 hours from mountains 
You get everything in Ohio though 
I would never want to leave 
Even if I didn't have family. Columbus is incredible 
That's why they have vacations 
 I hope I never have to leave Columbus 
Bye guys 
Logan is packing up his bags and is going to Cali 
Oh. That's not bad 
Niel, where are you going!?
And never move out west. We can be going to crew games together for the rest of our life
But get on that wait list 
If you got season tickets though, I could always get you into the nordecke 
You're a paying customer 
Beg them 
I think you're right actually 😔
You getting season tickets now that Julie has em ? 😏😊
That's awesome!
What the heck!!! You Colombians are ruthless!

Ye ye proud of you cray cray 
I'm proud of you Craig

Do you have premium 
LORD IS GOING TO CHINA 
Are we in pot 1 because we are hosting? 
What do you guys think of the copa centenario pots? 
They mad they're still nameless 
They just mad they ain't famous 
I eat the booty and I'm not ashamed

They just signed lavezzi
 I want a Chinese super league jersey for the jersey exchange next year 
I love the new Kanye 
I love the old Kanye 
I really do like it 
Brian is strictly a loser then 
Kanyes new album 
Everyone listen 
You'll have to go to tidal and match the songs up

The names aren't right on all of them though 
This album is incredible

I like your fashion, Niel 
The sock game is too strong. The off blue with the mocs in comparison to the suit. Doesn't match your shirt at all but is screams I'm a second cousin from the color palette I'm wearing, and I know what I'm doing. 
Damn. I didn't know cover men for GQ live in the Nasti natti
I've never seen him with her and I see him quite a bit
Were they dating coming into college or is she visiting?
Then she do probably be her 
Do she got the brown hair 
I see him
He is on a date 
Wyatt Messerly is one a one on one date with a cutie

How did Real Madrid not sign me into their youth academy 
At age three guys, I just started going for it

Yesssss😍😍😍
Newcastle is your new Fifa team 
He transferred over in the winter 
Yeah. 
I have two defenders not playing....
Rt if u cri
Wow. Props. That would take me years 

It is better than pretty good.... Are you crazy 
 He named the album after Pablo Escobar 
Listen to real friends. It's so good
Yeezy album 
 It was supposed to 
Like I physiologically depend on it 
I need life of Pablo to come out 
Yeah he is rumored to be going to inter
He can control an entire game if he wants to 
Yeah. Zabaleta is up there in age. Toure I feel they have a love hate relationship 
And zabaleta 
How do you feel about Toure most likely on the way out from city? 
Look at Chelsea 
They should. But weird things happen 
Our defense got so much better that last half since we got afful and suaro. It will be nice to have them for a full season 
It should be close though!! 
I don't know. Red bulls are still loaded and then the Galaxy 
Did you see Jac mac get in a fight in a preseason game today with RSL?
It's what being a fan is all about 
I know 😩 it sucks. But you gotta have faith this year 
The league would have to move away from a single entity though and that would create a dynasty for the la/ny/Orlando/Seattle of the world
But I hope we eventually get there for soccer 
Every mlb team as an affiliate for triple a all the way down to single a 
The Indians basically own the clippers players 
Like the clippers are a branch of the Indians 
Well farm teams are affiliations so you can't do that 
Yet at least 
I want promotion and relegation. I just don't think soccer is big enough here to do it 
Like Portland, Seattle, Orlando came to USL
If not, just as good 
Officially, NASL is recognized as 2nd tier. But USL really isn't that far behind 
Well there is a huge debate on that 
The only way you will play the cosmos is if you schedule a friendly or in US open cup 
Cosmos are in NASL
There are like 30 in the USL
Louisville city is their number one rival!!!!
I am 100% going as long as like something work or school related comes up and I'm excited 
I would be down there the whole weekend and we can chill as much as you are allowed ;)
If she minds it's okay! I can easily find somewhere to stay. 
Just an old friend 
Or I could ask Maggie 
Also, could I stay the night at your place or would zach's be better 
Tickets are only ten bucks but I'm pretty sure you can get them for 5. Can you look int that? I don't mind paying ten bucks if that's the case 
I planned on it but I have work for the opener 
But I want to go to the inaugural game too😩
Answer me 
I will be there as long as I don't have work 
Rivalry game 
April 16 is the game I want to go to 
NIEL
Anyone else coming to my birthday party? 
But I can honestly get there whenever 
Around 4 
Logan what is the plan tomorrow for my birthday party 
How many jealous 
How many of us 
Real friends 
http://www.breatheheavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kanye-west-real-friends.jpg
Adidas gets a say in it though 
 Good 
How long do we keep this jersey? Just a year or until we are allowed a new jersey 
We aren't the first to do a flag idea though 
You didn't even know what it was 
Answer: no one 
Who cares about the city flag 
Well the flag is terrible 
They should've just done an all white kit with a yellow Barbasol 
No baby blue and I would be okay with it 
The shorts are what kill it for me. Like just make them white 
I want the home jersey every year for as long as it changes 
I'll still get it most likely

I really wanted to get the jersey for my birthday too
These are bad 
Why does it seem like precourt has no knowledge of the kits. Stumbling over how he is to describe them. 
Looks like I'm going with a black one this year 
The yellow are for sure the tertiary kit 
The city flag is bottom left of the jersey 
It's supposed to be based on the city flag 
I'm literally upset 
Oh my gosh 
The new leaked crew jersey is sooooooo ugly 
Is anyone else trying to get WCQ tickets in Columbus? 
Nah. He came out with them forever ago 
Before the crew logo came out, this guy made 28 crests of what he would like to see and this was one of them 
Did I tell you guys I'm a season ticket holder and I get great perks? 
I'm so excited for this season 
Guys I love this crest 
He got so red in the face 
I asked if he went to poontown
We chillin 
@Zach Spangler Isaac kissed his girlfriend!! 
I asked to go with you Niel 
My mom wouldn't let me go to pharmacy school there lol 
And they complain crew attendance is bad
Yeah it is lol like I'm sure they would let us in free at this point 
Come over and watch, fam
FS1
Against Canada 
Yeah
The attendance has sucked for these friendlies. Abysmal 
Trapp has been in so many infographics

Real G's don't back down Niel 
Niel you really should have challenged him to a rap battle. Winner gets to stay in the apartment  
But Larry Barry just wanted a new pair of sperry's. But Larry Barry scared he ain't gonna marry. 
https://media2.giphy.com/media/111aqan7Hnw56E/giphy.gif
This guy is not a gangster. His real name is Larry. And Larry berry is real real hairy. And Larry berry loves night rides on the ferry. This guy don't wanna battle he shook. 
Things were getting kind of hairy for Larry. But for Neil it was scary 
Chris was his fence probably 
That is really freaky
Niel, be safe 
Zach, do you get free bagels or no 
Is it high? 
I'm white suburbia. 
What does wacked out mean
Someone did that to Baylee's apartment too and it freaked her out 

I'm glad you guys are okay. That is really really scary. 
9 milli above the go wire?
Niel, do you pack heat?
Like on accident or a thief/murderer 
What...
I'm really sorry 😔
Best friends reunited 
I'm sorry guys...
Jesus... That stuff tears me up. Like I feel like it was my dog. Was it chron's diseases? 
Why.

Brian if we started the next cvs....
I've never made dean's list like all my fellow comrades in this chat 
I only have a 3.21
You wouldn't want me as a business partner 
I want to be a professional athlete 
I literally have been pretty close to just going to apply to med school 
We're under appreciated 
Back off 
I'm a pill pusher 
I can't be the only one not to get my masters out of the group 
I want to do one now 
It's called the illuminati 
Niel. You can write articles and not be a journalist 
I can't stand MUN either. But I need you to represent me and my fellow colleagues goals and desires and make MUN great again. 
You think the presidential candidates like the US as it is now? No. That's why they do something about

You have to do that! 
Wow....
I was thinking man united 
I was just on google looking up what that was 😂
This galaxy team....
But rare words give you an advantage on tiebreakers
Is just like scattegories or whatever but you have as much time as the person took before you to answer them. So I can answer one and stop it in 6 seconds and then you have six seconds to get one or more or I can try to answer them all and then you get that time limit to answer them all
It's called stop 
Thanks Craig for getting me that rare word bonus
Injuries like that always suck.  Especially when it is a top performer. It ruins everything if you keep him on the team long enough his value drops 
Brian take the phone away from your girlfriend, again 
That means you're on the gay train 
My fantasy hopes die with every Arsenal dropped result 
Arsenal just cannot score. They have been beating down the door for 48 minutes now 
Correct Brian 
The touch was ridiculous but one on one with the keeper? Forster has made really good saves though 
You picked de bruyne
Özil has missed three sitters. All inside the 6 
Good to see followers with the Aguero captain pick. A league of disparity 
Great captain pick Brian. The man that is out two weeks will surely get you a lot of points 
Buzzeslikeafridges comment has my dying. 

😂😂
You're a warmballer now, Brian 
We are genetically more superior and physical in comparison to pele and George best, etc 
I don't like doing all time comparisons 
I wish Messi played in the PL during his prime
 You watch kicktv now? 
I thought you hated it 
He just won the ballon  D'or. There are no excuses if he game 
There are players older than him that have done it in the PL 
Man up Messi 
The fact there was Messi rumors to city before pep makes these rumors even more plausible 
Not a good showing from our crew boys though :(
Goods and bads to take away 
Why is Tchani wearing under armor clears now. Is he sponsored ?? 
Yeah, not a good day for zardes. He usually kills it or is abysmal in national team games. No in between 
 Altidore's first touch has been major poopy
Well that was poop 
I want to see him do well so badly 😩
Finlay is getting smashed on Reddit lol 
He can only beat mediocre talent 1v1
But all his critics say he is one dimensional 
He has not played well for sure. He will probably struggle to get call ups unfortunately 
Michael Bradley is a baller. Such a good passer
Lee Nguyen has looked pretty good I think 
What the F
ZARDES 
Zardes is invisible 
Good job Brian 
He is a young defender. I don't mind him. 
Finlay touch a little heavy there
Just curious 
How is Nagbe not starting over Nguyen 
Your contributions to the group chat has been JB, 1d, and keeping up with the ksrdashians 😂
Has your girlfriend had your phone all weekend? 
Brian what is happening to you 
He is suspended and no club teams want him 
I'm happy with the line up but ditch jones for literally anyone 
I think zardes will be a false 9 then? 
It makes no sense to me. 
Right now 
He is suspended 6 games... And doesn't have a club team which means it will have to be international. He adds nothing to our lineup right 
Why is jones still starting 
Michael orozco is trash
We can choose whether to do head to head or overall like PL
I want to 
Actually a 1-1 draw 
1-0 Iceland 
Only because Baylee loves JB. Like the only reason I like his new album is because she played it constantly. Otherwise it's a good song 
I hate it 
Love yourself has been stuck in my head for a month now 
What games are you watching 
I'm what contest 
He will have 0 flair 
He is a defensive mid
Wil Trapp should 100% play and if Jurgen plays him out on the wing again I will kill him 
USA v Iceland today 
You all are my best friends 
Happy birthday, alejo. You are my best friend.

Watching two brazilians at my school play ping pong, both utilizing the pen grip. It might be an international thing
Match. First home match isn't until April 
I know! I have been reading up on them. They look like they will be a pretty damn good team. And I'll come down otherwise! You just need to tell me a weekend and I need to make sure it's a relatively light weekend for me 
FC Cincinnati plays at nip pert. The new USL team? If you go to UC, tickets are 5 dollars... I want to see a game 
You and me like our days at Hamilton, playing basketball in the meadows 
Niel! I have a proposition to hang out!!!!
I want to go to a game so badly 
This copa America tournament will be interesting to watch 
I don't know about that still. We weren't supposed to get out of the group last World Cup and we did. Jurgen hasn't played the same lineup in back to back games since the World Cup. He is always throwing people around. I want to have a lineup with out best players and I think we can still hang with average European countries 
I don't know how much of these prospects are from Bradley's regime but you're right. Our youth prospects are not so hot 
Our youth is supposed to be what Jurgen is so good with. He is adamant we aren't good enough know which is true. But if there is not advancement in the youth system then he really needs to go 
Christian Pulisic is making some waves over in Dortmund 
I think Geoff Cameron is our best player right now. Why did Jurgen wait so long to call him in 
No Fabian Johnson!? 
Not prospects or on the future. I mean at this second of January the 27th 
Who are our top five national team players today? 

I don't know if he is actually worse though. I mean I think brazillians just choose to field younger level talent 
Also, Matt Miazga to Chelsea? That's pretty big 
http://espnfc.com/soccer-transfers/story/2795019/alexandre-pato-arrives-in-london-to-seal-chelsea-loan
Like that is still a prime age for soccer. That is crazy 
Unless the article on ESPN is wrong 
How 
26....
Anyone wanna guess how old Alexander Pato is? 
I saw we do Kelleys island or put in bay again. Good memories are there 
I would love to do a camping trip 
We can do whatever. Camping is very cheap if we wanted to do an extended weekend. 
We went to Kelleys Island a few years ago with Zach and it was incredible 
Or kelleys island 
Put in bay for a weekend! 
I'm down for something else but my family is going that week so I'm for sure going that week 
Haven't heard from Niel 
Craig is in 
If so is the place we had last year okay again? 
Is myrtle beach just going to be Julie, Logan, McCoy this year? 
Thanks homie 
Logan are my Hurley phantoms at your house? 
I haven't heard anything about him 
We only have two rosters forwards
Why not just keep j Mac then 
Like why

Ohio state hockey game again 
Everyone is separated 
Haha i can't

Everyone is trying to get me drunk already

She is trying to fulfill the hero's quest myth
I never said that Logan wouldn't give her the time of day. 
She definitely fabricated some of the stuff I said 
Jk. I'm fine guys 
Some say I'm desperate too 
Some say she is bad news 
 Ex of mine 
Maggie called me today and we talked for an hour if anyone cares 
You can sign in with your cable provider and then you get to pick any game you want to watch 
I watch it online and stream it to the tv 
You and Logan have

You're isis, Brian 
From özil 
Jesus guys 
I never said they would die 
I literally wouldn't feel bad if isis kidnapped the entire team and we never saw them again 
I hate Chelsea
I'm seriously pissed right now 
F Arsenal 
I started  giroud 
Wow 
That's the second time this year we have gone down to ten men inside 20 minutes 
I hate Chelsea. Why can't Arsenal ever have a decent game 
Someone talk to me. I need friends 
Logan, what did you decide on the app? 
It's making it so much more interesting 
Smart move making it so we can have multiples of the same player 
This fantasy race is going to be really good

Hat trick from deli alli or Scott dann I'm hoping

I could always bring it to Meijer and you could pick it up there 
I don't know when I'm getting it to you since I am at work now, then I go straight to Meijer depending on the time my preceptor lets me go 
What time are you leaving? 
I also have the limited edition Messi case you got for pre ordering still in the original packaging

Well you let me know what that is 
What time will you guys wake up for morning heroclix and coffee 
When can I come over 
He is ignoring us 
All night 
Craig has his phone in his hand 
No one understands 
Craig is a gay boy and needs a week to unpack his stuff 
You tell me when to be there 
I can be there when you guys wake up 
I can come after midnight if you guys want
And nah. I'm not coming. What time can I come tomorrow? 
Bbc 
My family is having a party this year and I don't know if we are expected to be there or not

Are we doing New Years at Logan's or no 
Does Toledo use examsoft? 
I can't get it because it messes up examsoft. I don't know if you need that for class or not 
Niel, Baylee broke up with me 
When is the jersey exchange 
I don't think I'm going to come 
My preceptor emailed me and said I need to come in at four not 9
I work 9am to the 9pm tomorrow 
Maybe if I become an astronaut Baylee will take me back 
Switching to aerospace engineering 
I built this 
He is embarrassed now and won't let me take a picture of it 
Jacket and pants 
Aka all denim 
Craig asked and received a Mexican tuxedo for Christmas...
Opened up all my presents, didn't get Baylee back 😔 Santa isn't real. That's the only thing k wanted 
https://media2.giphy.com/media/H6t1qkcmG52Gk/giphy.gif
Baylee was 20 when she broke up with me 
Saucin, saucin, I'm saucin on you 
Yes he did 
I did 
I'm just saying 
Baylee was kind of a red head 
The Galaxy are so top heavy 
It's nicholas_casto@yahoo.com 
Why do you need my email? 
Alejo, why don't you have an ennay
How is the car still running then? How much damage? 
Sounds Gucci 
Is Google wallet and app
Are we doing pizza tonight? Will I need cash? Or does anyone have the venmo app
@Zach Spangler I can stop by your house and pick your stuff up? Have Isaac or Ben or Wendy get it ready if you want 
Sounds good
Yeah to what Craig 
Is this a sleepover or just chill 
The latest I get off is three
Is it possible to do something tonight? 
I got the Lord's jersey 
Actually that's mean. 
I hope someone got you an Omar Gonzalez jersey. How ironic would that be 
That's treason 
Why did he go to pachuca!!
It's Christmas with the grandparents on lake Erie 
Let's do the exchange for sure on the first at some point in the afternoon. I'm almost positive we won't be here that weekend unfortunately 
I'll be home for the first, maybe not the 2-3 
Soccer classic? 
Are we hanging out tomorrow night? 
If you sign on, it tells you how many days you have left to disputed your case 
Did you run out of the protection thing? Did you try to email the seller 
Well I have gifts that were specifically tailored to her that I can't return so what else would I do with it 
Well I work until 3 and go straight to Meijer to work until 9. And I work Tuesday 6-3 then meeting with Baylee to do Christmas presents and end it, and Wednesday I work 6-3
When are we hanging out, guys 
Baylee and I are done 
Nesquik is by far the best. No question 
Sorry boys
I guess it's cool. It was free and I totally forgot about it and three years later I found it 
Brian, I have a pretty cool Christmas gift for you. I got it for you three years ago and forgot to give it to you and I just found it 😂
McCoy is going to dat school right there. 
Niel, you said you couldn't do it on Christmas Eve 
Guys, I'll take a rain check this year. I seriously can't call off sick with this lady. It's a long story

It's not the hard to get home from here lol. It's two roads 
Just come over and say you wanted to see me! 
Where is everyone working out over break? 
Mah jersey came 
Bro. I put you on ya back bro. Have ya eyes poppin out ya head bro. Give you two concussion in one punch bro.
Do they have a podcast by any chance? Do you know 
Ballin, ballin, Iverson on youuuuuu oh 
Zone* not one 
They can't sit back and counter because they don't score first 😂 they are a basketball team that only plays one and when they switch to man to man they get killed. 
They won't win the league this year 
They have the talent to win the league... They picked up Pedro and returned the whole team 
Mourinho's buyout clause though. Hella expensive. Sucks for Chelsea to have to pay that 
Moyes was gone after one season 
You got your manager sacked too 
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
Post Malone is good too
Mourinho is out!
You're a regular 
That's like the third time you've been on there

I am crying....
Isaac 😂😂😂😂
Anybody like my signed picture of Kei?
We are planning the soccer classic during the week. I think you'll be fine 
It depends on what my Meijer schedule is for this weekend 
I don't think I will be able to go this year homie 
I work 7-3 every day except eve and Christmas 
That's all I got for you guys 
I work until three on the day before Christmas Eve 
However I think you should get sacked for the foreign courses on you schedule 
Proud of you 
Go Niel!!
What do you think about "foreign" players though 
AND FABIAN JOHNSON. Our best player this year 
The women win the World Cup and everyone still cares about the men's team. I think she is just jealous a little
And she is jealous of the women's pay in comparison to men 
What she said was wrong. But she has some substance 
She has no point then? At all? 
Takes on Abby Wambach's comments? 
What's everyone's work schedule 
Are we doing it on Christmas Eve it moving it up a day for Niel 
It's inconceivable 
How crazy would that be 
Craig, your team sucks. I really hope they get relegated 
For the lucky guy that has the privilege of me picking their jersey 
My jersey is in the United States 
But I don't really know the situation. She is two hours away. I'm just going off what she tells me and her location service 
😔 I know you guys are right. I just can't believe this is happening again 
If they were at each other's apartments. That's different 
They're in public places 
I'm relatively comfortable with it 
I can't do that. I drove down yesterday to take her to dinner and we are fine I guess. She said she isn't going to break up with me. But she wants to be friends with him. I mean she doesn't do anything except work out with him so I can't be mad I guess. I told her there is a line and even flirtatious texts would be the end of things so I think things are covered 
Skip Bayless is Baylee's sports  persona so I call her skip 
Baylee 
Skip is working out again with Ian 
Guys I'm a push over 😔
Will someone take my physio exam for me 
That's all 
I fell 
I hate bengals fans more than anything 
I hate the bengals. But also the steelers 
I haven't got mine either yet 
They can take awhile cus they coming from China 
And Fifa tournament 
Xmas break! We got the soccer classic and the jersey exchange 
I just don't have it on my phone 
I don't even have Facebook anymore. 
What's a TLDR?
I'm gonna fix it. I'm going to lay down the law. Give her one chance. I know she loves me and she is just struggling with the distance. But she is completely worth it 
I'm not ready to end it. Plus all the Christmas gifts I got her
I think I have to wait until after break 
I don't know 
They just lifted and went to chipotle. 
It could be just nothing 
I don't know what to do 
But I'm not going though what I did with Maggie 
I don't want to though 
I'm fine with the distance and I told her I didn't want to date unless she was completely over Ian. I didn't want him to be a factor and I don't know if he is becoming one 
She didn't do any bring though. I don't mind she hung out with him. The fact she is thinking about ending it because of distance is what gets me 
I don't know what to do 
I know. I mean she didn't break up with me because she said she isn't ready to and doesn't want to yet. She wants to have Christmas break. Her chief complaint is the distance. She isn't getting that higher level of connection. I wasn't too worried about her hanging out with him. She just like hid it from me. Which is weird 
And yes
Didn't break up yet. They broke up beginning of summer. 
She admitted to me she still loves him and it would still take awhile to not get over him. She is scared about distance now. She went to chipotle with him after. 
Logan she was at the gym with ian... Her ex boyfriend 
She is being so weird 
I think me and Baylee are done...
I don't care. I told her to get lunked with Logan. I'm down for pointers from veterans 
Logan, Baylee said you was helping her get down low on her squats the other day? Care to explain!? 
If you can't beat your dogs, how will you be able to redeem yourself against Logan 
Is it a league? I'm curious to what the three point line is 
How many kitchen basketball games do you play a week? 
He did sign an extension when you got it. I remember telling Brian it was a good jersey pick 
Don't have that many. I wish ONU was bigger. 
I need like 5 a side 
I really want to play footy 
I don't mind the song 
Everyone, if you turn your tv to a channel that it doesn't receive, 1 percent of that static is remnants of the Big Bang. YOU ARE LITERALLY WATCHING THE BIRTH OF OUR UNIVERSE

ALEJO
She doesn't have a Mac 
 Unless you plan on going on sketch websites 
Did someone tell you? 
Who is asking? 
No 
That seems dangerous. What was the exam in? 
Universal test question answer 
Mitochondria is the power house of the cell, Brian 
I actually got an 84. She just can't math 
63 on my physio exam... I don't know how I did that bad. I went from an 83 to a 75 in one exam and I have no chance of getting a B now 
Crew lost 
I am having the worst week ever 
No 
Los dos hermanos guerra 
Si claro!
The crew would struggle next year unless we replaced him 
Someone so dominant wanting to retire 
Kei Kamara was going to retire if we won...
1. Yes 
2. Listening to podcasts. Send the occasional text message 
3. I am worried. I try to limit texting to when I'm stopped.  
If she didn't that's pretty bad lol
Did she? 
She was going to the gym and then doing a cycle class/circuit thing
Did you say anything? 
Well it's a pretty large campus 
At the gym?

We are in contract negotiations with jmac, George, and the someone else 
Lampson, speas, jmac, kevan George and someone else are out of contract 
And so is pogatetz
Kristin is cut!!!
6am kick off anyone? 
How early!? 
18th
And he can't take penalties 
Sometimes pipa gets too cute and he has zero speed. My only complaints 
I would actually be okay with replacing Higuain 
I'm nervous about buying another forward. We would have to go to a 442
Maybe Sergio Campbell is that replacement 
Meram played really well last night 
If an upgrade from Tchani is there. Take it 
Start looking for a replacement for Parkhurst 
Replacement for Meram 
If we keep the same team we will no doubt be good. But you still have to get better. You can't settle and be complacent 
 All those are two year spans. Look at the Seahawks this year 
I'm still clad in crew gear today 
Roster decisions happen and you always have to look for someone better to replace 
I would love to keep everyone but you always have to get better. 
The works in like zero percent of sports leagues 
I honestly could. 
Okay I'm really sad we lost now 😔
No I can. It just will suck going to Columbus for work at 6 am if we do 
Can we change the group chat name 😔
I'm done the 18th but have an internship the week before Christmas at the hospital 
I can't wait to see everyone over break 
That's pretty sweet 
I was on the verge of it 
Was I crying? 
Live*
I'll always remember this and I'm glad I was apart of it. But the fans ruined the experience. Very bad representation. Makes us a laughing stop. It's no wonder people hate us and we won't ever lift this down 
And just think. Nycfc and orland won't be bad forever. They have money and you can throw money at people in win. Plus the galaxy have an odd year down. The odds of us ever hosting another cup could be very slim. 
I'm happy with the season. It just sucks to lose and have the fans react the way they did. That's what I'm most disappointed about. We can out flat and were chasing the entire game. Portland deserves to win that game. The fans and the way we lost is just disappointing 
This sucks 
They had 11 behind the ball the entire game. There is no way we were going to execute normally 
They are just going to sit behind the ball and counter 
Yeah they did outplay us but they were up 2-0 inside ten minutes 
Embarrassed too. The fans throwing the beer cans on the field. Sooooo embarrassing 
I mean it sucks. Especially to lose that way. We had 60 minutes to equalize so I can't really complain. Terrible call but you have to play until the whistle. They teach you that since pre school league. 
Where you guys at? 
I know. I hate her 
It's 20 bucks 
Like price? 
Piss off mate!
Same bro 
And I'm talking about what panera bread are you talking about 
That's not campus bro 
11th? 
On what street? 
Where are you going, me and Baylee will meet 
Craig can I come 
What times is everyone getting there 
https://media2.giphy.com/media/IWQAurn8xEVFu/giphy.gif
Doing what? 
Plus my stub 
I have three tickets printed for tomorrow 
Have you printed your ticket off yet? 
Craig is your ticket a nordecke ticket? 
Okay 
Well never mind 
How far is it? Imma park at p2 and walk with you to save 20 bucks 
You're walking to the stadium? 
Leave?
Be ready tomorrow Craig 
That's why the made Ohio state. To play footy 
Or we stick with us and play iron site 
Ever 
Niel you haven't won a trophy yet...
The weekend is finally here 
Soooooooo MLS cup final on Sunday 
Wat
https://media1.giphy.com/media/gugBc3Fb8BwME/giphy.gif
How much are they going to swell those for? 30 bucks? 
A tad bland but I'll still buy it 
Perfect 
We should all go in different ushers to get into the nordecke just to be safe 
Craig stop copying me 
I'm going to be there at 1:30
Gates to the stadium open at 2
I'm totally buying one
They're selling MLS cup scarves!!? 
I'm trying to get to the stadium as early as possible 
Do they stadium gates open at two or the parking gates or both? 
What time are you guys getting there 
Or I could print like 7
I probably will print off like two or three and we will have to send runners 
Then I just give you guys paper copies 
I will be able to get in regardless if I bring both 
I don't see why not 
They sent me a hard copy of my ticket for the game Sunday, so I thought I wasn't able to print it. But I can. 
If you guys are still trying to get in 
Never mind. I think you can still print tickets 
Does anyone still have the ticket from last game? We can try to use that 
They sent me a ticket stub... Not printable ticket 
I don't know how I'm getting you guys into the nordecke 
I wish I was Brian. He gets two jerseys this year 
Jersey exchange purchased 
I almost did 
Ibra 
Ibra 
Orlando waived Adam Bedell. We basically got j Mac for free 
Alabama at 5th 
Has osu in top four 
 Did you guys see Colin cowherd destroy the sec 
My blanket all week 
You're welcome Thierry 
https://media1.giphy.com/media/l3VNrcTgE8QG4/giphy.gif
I'm just kidding guys 
I'm ingrained in the Columbus Crew culture 
I saw more games than you guys. 
I was a season ticket member of a magical season 
Win or lose 
 I mean, people go their whole lives not seeing their favorite team play in a championship 
I've read every crew article like 6 times on mlssoccer
All day 
I cannot focus 
We will be at crew stadium for an MLS cup 
Guys 
Already got it taken care of 
I'm getting there when the gates open next weekend 
I will be tailgating all day
So weird to celebrate in an empty stadium 
Now I just need someone to cover my shift....
WE DID IT 
OMG 
What was that 
Guys 
We should have scored there 
My stomach is in knots 
I don't see them getting four either 
We need to score while we are up two. That is heart breaking for them 
But NY is the highest scoring team in the league. They are desperate. It's going to be nerve wracking 
The counter is wide open right now 
I feel if it's 2-1 then we will play more defensively to try to preserve the aggregate score 
We have to score while its 2-0
Pooping 
I was popping 
They will both be counter goals 
I say 1-2 crew for you 
Fox sports to go
 I'm nervous 
Dirty
This game is crazy! 
And there is very little chance osu gets in 
Playoff soccer time!
That was pretty crazy 
The whole room was dying 
My grandma just asked whose 7 cents was on this bench and I said I don't know but I can give you my two cents of who it was 😂😂😂😂
It's physics are more like real life

He asked 
Can we add Zach back? 
Speas and Swanson
One of them is 17
We have 5 
We have like 4 
What? 
SKC
The trend is definitely changing 
It's because they use a lot of homegrowns 
Yep 
We changed it a long time ago too 
I am going crazy 
This is incredible 
We could be at an MLS final!!!!!!
I'm freaking out 
 GUYS WHAT THE HECK 
They give me my money back 
Fcd got a crucial goal back 
I will be there the second gates open if we host it 
Well I will try to get you guys in by printing off.....6 tickets lol 
Like now 
Buy your MLS cup tickets now 
Portland up 2-0!!!!???
Seriously you guys are idiots for leaving so late 
Hurry up

Us 
2-1 
The nordecke is 
Half full already 
Me and Craig are getting to the game at 4
Well we deserved to lose then 
Defense did their job I would say 
But we only have up 17 points 
Poor play calling. It's almost like urban wants to show off how many players we have so he limits the play calls 
Why is your heisman candidate only getting ten carries a game 
Yes. Why do you not have your only heisman candidate running the football 
Zeke with only two carries the entire second half? 
Yeah. I have no idea. I couldn't watch the game. Sounds like it's a good thing I didn't though 
Braxton is our best receiver and he has only played a year...
They've struggled
I don't know. Our offense just isn't the same this year 
Not a good sporting weekend for the Buckeyes 
The basketball team lost to UT-Arlington yesterday 
I'm nervous

Pizza tonight?
I'm at work 
And give me some for free 
All of them 
Zach bring the clix
I'll be there 
I'll be there at 7:30-8
Heroclix and Fifa

Dank after 
I have work til 7 
Are we hanging out Saturday night or no 
I probably won't go home until Saturday morning 
At least here it is
It's supposed to be cold and rainy isn't it?

Baylee doesn't have any brothers so it's just us 
I would like to extend my groomsman invitations to all of you right now 
Friends for life 
What are you doing Saturday night and leading up to the crew game 
That's sweet. When do you leave to go down there? 
Why can't Raj come up :( I haven't seen him in a blue moon 
You'll be in SC 
You can't play so shut up. 
Badly 
I'm crazing heroclix
Z dank. What you doing Saturday noche? 
We definitely are a friend group that is incomparable to anyone else. 
As in you're losing or gaining weight?

That's good then
Well I don't want to pay for anything 
I have to be at MCW at 6 am 
By the way. Can I sleep over in your dorm next Monday-Wednesday 
Because they are scared. I can see why they do it but that doesn't mean I support it 
Racism basically 
They won't let Syrian refugees in Ohio due to the attacks 
I see why they don't, but still think it's a very knee jerk reaction 
I'm a little surprised Ohio won't support letting refugees in

It makes me so mad 
Why are we playing a wcq on a baseball field 
You getting me a ticket for free? 
Niel. When is the crosstown shootout this year 
What's the line up for the qualifying game tonight? 
Think. The opportunity may only come once in awhile 
I mean how many times could the crew get this far in the playoffs 
How important are they 
Crew game 
Yes Niel 
I would say Neymar has probably surpassed them now. Messi and Ronaldo will always be better than him in their primes though 
But Nagbe.....
And marry that girl 
And then put on a ring 
Literally her fingers 
Ask her for the digits

Not street but garage 
Ligue 2
Is Le Havre on Fifa?

I told you guys he would be a star 
That's my boy 
So yes 
Him? 
What must I do 
Please 
Please 
Zach forgive me 
I work with the man 
ZACH I AM SORRY 
At least Robert said he out the switch in the schedule for Sunday 
Yeah I can. 
 Niel, buy the cheapest ticket and I'll print mine off twice so you can get into the nordecke with us 
How much are they on sale 
Please 
Forgive me 
I'm sorry dank. I'm just excited I can go to the game now 
Robert took my Sunday shift!
I work until 7 
That's what I meant
It's a Sunday at 7 
22nd
Drink it in. It always goes down smooth 
Be in the nordecke with your pals for the first time ever 
Pull the trigger my friend 
Niel, you want it, you got it 
Zach. Buy my ticket 
Brian. Buy my ticket 
Thank. You. I told Robert. He might buy it. I could tell some guys up here 
I'm so upset 😔
Well tell your friends, if they want a ticket, 25 bucks 
And I can't get it off 
Work 
 Craig will be there too
McCoy, if you want my ticket, 25 bucks 
I can't go to the eastern conference finals game 
I'm back in the fantasy league 
I have an exam Wednesday and Friday :(
I'll look into it once I get home 

Hmmm
Huh?
Dank, Crew game tomorrow? 
Craig, I'm sorry for whatever I did. Honestly. You're a great brother 
And you felt so strongly that I should be out of the family? 
How old were you Craig? 8? 
I am hurt Craig 
6 years ago my brother wanted me out of the family 
Craig, please

 NAGBE FINALLY GETS HIS CALL UP FOR THE US 
I don't know why I'm thinking of the revolution game 
We play Sunday! 
Never mind 
Although the attendance will be pretty bad most likely because the Buckeyes have a night game 
I  am so excited for this game 
Do you remember sitting in your basement in 2008 as young soccer fans losing our championship virginity? We watched that game together. We watched the crew beat the red bulls. Feel pure ecstasy again. The championship. Two good ol pleas from the begging of time cheering on their boyhood club. Columbus is calling you to duty. Stand up soldier 
Zach go to this game. It's a huge game! For the Cup, For Columbus 
So kiss me on a cold December night 
Mom's spaghetti 
The thing is, the sports entertainment industry will never be capped. You're always going to be paying more every year for the best guy. There is no dollar amount where you stop. The second you pay college athletes, which I'm for and against, is the second try become professionals. Let them go straight to pros if you're going to pay them. Because the second they institute pay for college athletes, our tuition goes up because colleges don't get as much in return as they were because they have to pay the athletes 
We aren't going to make you money. That's why. The education system became flawed when it stopped being an education system and more of a big business. The school gets money for media coverage, national tv coverage, winning championships. It only makes sense the cheat to get recruits and use all their money on them. Osu made millions for winning the national championship. What would I do for them? Nothing. 
It sucks that it has to be that way but it will never change 
Ehhhhh. I mean it was an alarming video 
✅
Yeah 
Niel comes from Sweden 
Send in your jersey specs por favor 
Everyone text Julie the size jersey you want and the jerseys/players you absolutely do not want or any other preferences you would like 
That's awesome! I saw the one we won at crew stadium 
Kiss me through the phone 
Nah man. That's soulja boys number 
6789998212
We need to assign jerseys for the exchange if we are doing it?
That's where I was for the World Cup game 
Is McCoy going?
Go to the crew game 
Why are you going to duke?
Who all will be there next weekend? 
Not an awful result 
I feel confident 
Weird substitution 
Cedric shouldn't even be in 
How did I ruin it? My message never said anything of the result 
He was at midfield with the ball and got dispossessed, no one else back and it was one on one 
That's our captain 
Wow 
Pretty sure he'd give you a bj of you asked 
Drogba goes down so easily 
Were we playing zone or man? 
THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY PLEASE 
HIGUAIN PLEASE 
That rabona pass!!!
That's why I am not a referee 
Handling for sure 
Never mind 
That goal should have counted 
Ever think of that?
http://www.collectorscache.com/StoreModules/ProductImages/871/revive102.jpg
Higuain has not started off very well
8
7
Sub him off for Kevan George 
why is he chipping the keeper!?
I agree 
Not Ray Lewis 
I should be announcing and commentating 
You can blow all your money as an athlete and get bailed out as a sportscaster. 
I hate when ESPN does it 
Because with all sports now, they hire former athletes instead of those that go to school and actually get degrees in journalism and communications 
CLB: Finlay, Kamara 
MTL: Diddy
 2-1 yellow soccer sunshine club
He started the last three games 
We signed him over the summer 
What defender 
😂😂😂 sucker 
That outstep from Lukaku....
He should have picked up Kone on the run 
 Yedlin probably won't be starting anymore....
2-1 to the canary yellow men 
Same 
No chance 
Even if they did, you would have to use a DP slot 😂
None of those managers would come over here
Bob Bradley
Spell it wrong 😂
I'm going to get "Duane" on the back lol 
I might get him a jersey for Christmas 
He loves Everton 
Duane would be pleased 
  That was pretty 
 I just turned it on
 Patrick Sabol just bought tickets to see them 
For real. Pretty boring so far 
How has he not proved himself to you? 
Pirlo, Gerrard, Lampard all need to be cut 
Not half season 
I said first full season
Nah it's weird 
Double post and out to win the game.....
Oh my gosh 😂SKC does not want to win 
These penalties suck...
I had a dream last night and you were in it McCoy. It was weird. I debated telling the group and I opted not 
SKC. They've been here before 
Well in terms of when the goals happen 
SKC scored with three minutes left in the game to tie and then Portland scored with two minutes left in extra time to tie 
Free stream on Univision 
One goal in each in extra time it's 2-2 about to go to penalties 
Nope
 This Portland game is so good 
I would say so. We get them at home second so I hope we are a little more conservative while we are there. We don't have to win. Away goals are nice which is what concerns me with our defense and how Drogba has been killing it. He is due for one 
Montreal is a good team. I'm excited though 
 Well. Our defense has stepped it up but it will be tough stopping Drogba
Hat trick Rick just wasn't enough 
 They had the wrong Don Ovan playing 
Fair enough lol. The third one, tickets slipped on the awful turf and was out of position 
Agreed. Did you see his defense on the second goal 
Soooo crew playoffs 
http://www.screeninsults.com/images/dodgeball-goodman-fat.jpg
Brian what is you opinion on Gerrard 
 It really does make me happy 
MLS needs to get rid of Gerrard, Pirlo, and Lampard. All trash 
Down goes the galaxy
Why aren't these games on tv
Jermaine Jones is literally scum 
Thanks buddy!
That's sweet. Should I email him then? 
I might send an email over this way 
That's the guy the residency director emailed for me! I'm waiting to hear back from him 
Sweet. Thank you! 
I have three years lol 
Actually you don't have to 
Unless you think that's weird. 
Give him my email 
Tell him my name!!!
Don't steal my residency spot 
Is it interesting? 
It should be an Olympic sport over soccer 
It's actually interesting 
An ultimate frisbee guy came on and they said it's like soccer but better. 
It's so sad 
Sports nation trashed soccer so bad today 
We are on the max air and Craig had his coins literally flying out of his pockets. The coins were floating in the air when we got to the top. He lost like 3 dollars in change😂
Remember max air and Craig's pennies 😂😂
Quite a few people on mlssoccer.com not happy with the lack of call ups for Ethan Finlay
And it was in my notes. It has been since 2013 
I'm the league historian 
Fair enough. I will remove said title 
Why can't you recognize my accomplishments 
Deal 
Do people who get first place get an award? 
Tell me right now 
Tell me McCoy 
Why am I still number one then 
What am I missing? 
Is that correct?

Was there a third place game?
How, nagbe is class 
Is that final? 
But I'll be there if you get them!
But now I cant
If you asked me before the 19th yes 
I won a trophy too guys...
4 jmacs ahead of dcunited!!
This crew game!!!!
I opened my time capsule from 5th grade... I had a sports illustrated paper Freddy Adu card and wrote a paper how I want to be him and he is my idol... Wasted idol 
Freddy Adu is betterb
You could fake chow some ugly chick for 20 dollars. Voila 
But I mean, it's 20 dollars 
Unless you don't want to do it 
Everyone would still get a jersey with odd numbers lol  
We could still do it though?
Yeah. Just make sure  the dank is included or not 
And we need a jersey exchange picking 
Thanksgiving Fifa tournament is coming up! 
I'm at work. I can't be defensive as much as I want 
I am garbage at Fifa 
Not Fifa 
That makes you the Chivas USA though 
But I have more than one championship so I can't be them 
Guess again 
I have one a trophy in each 
March madness, MLS, epl
I can afford to give away a trophy here and there. My fantasy reputation is still pretty good. 
Congrats to Logan 
I lost fair and square 
Niel, you don't even have history to talk about. I don't even know how you can defend yourself 
I've been around the top in fantasy for two years and haven't ever started a Tottenham player 
I work until 6
I have a ticket to the crew game if anyone wants it 
They needed that big time 
They still have a lot of work to do in the champions league 
I don't. It's all good 
That's fine. Next time 
I can't see at all 
My teas gone cold. Morning rain is clouding up my window 
What's the forecast loog 
I'm at work, so let me know what the plan is when it gets closer to 7
Logan you still on? 
Soccer today? 
You should have objected 
A larp proposal?

Avada Kadavra, Craig 
Craig, you're human 
I call bow master 
We will play it by ear then!
Is the weather supposed to be somewhat nice? 
Sweet. I'll leave straight from work, so I'll text you when I leave 
Did you play? 
😂😂😂😂 Brian throwing shade 
I'm still hanging around the top, like usual. You better bury me now or you'll regret it come the end of the season 
Latinos have never won a fantasy championship, Brian. Remember that 
That's awesome! Brian, bring home the cup! 
There*
Is their playoffs now?
Please, I would like a challenge 
I didn't even suffer double digit losses...
Let me know 
Sweet 
I get off at 7, I'm going down and then staying the night at Baylee's 
Footy? 
Logan, what are you doing Saturday evening/night 
I want to be there so bad 

Rivalry game for a bye week? 
Game is at 5
I have work until 6
I can't go either 😩
The crew game this weekend will be huge 
Portland gave you a butt whoopin
Andre move, Niel 
Winner gets to be Kev and Jen 
We shall create a quiz and have them all take it 
Who's gf knows the most football 
That takes care of that 
Anyone have AIDS and want to admit it? That would clear someone up as a character 
Why does every NFL player to the Ronaldo celebration... I've seen at least 3 this season 
I'll be Kevin with my super thin pants in the flower shop if Brian is Sophia 
You all suck at fantasy 
I'm the oracle 
Get all the babes 
I'm the coolest 
How! I'm Pete 
What!? I need to make trades and stock up on play off teams 
Are you serious? 
Wait what? 
Last every single year 
😂😂😂 the Andre of the group 
In the library 
I had the carilho rocking the other day 
Or whatever the age is 
We need Zach to be 35 
They are saying "zeeeeeeeeeeeeke"
I was laughing maniacally for forever 
What a game 
Abc or ESPN 
Craig, what's dad doing 
I'm so happy!!!!
OH MY GOD 
Who did they play?
Trillium cup is ours!!
Ethan Finlay!!!!!!
Fantasy week is struggling for the technical swag boys 
Wow 😂
What the hell is a wonder cracker 
Craig will be happy 
Lotus cheek is starting 
Vag chin 
Draw Brutus breaking the back of a bearcat over his leg 
Like a window pain with a dynamic curtain 
Carve out an little window and set the engagement ring in the window. Light the candle and ask her to marry you 
Niel, I love the look you're rocking now a days. Today you looked like a highly intelligent professor or something. I maybe stared at you for a good five minutes. Maybe a historian look? I don't know. But you keep doing you 
Suck it Brian, I'm not last 
I'm changing my name to Nikoli Putin Castov
I was dying in laughter when Zach told me the story too 
I wish I were joking. 
Zach, I remember you giving that paper/presentation in Bigam's class and Richard (the only black kid in the whole high school) was in there too 😂
I wrote a paper and turned it in today how Hitler was a hero...
Zach, I passed you on Monday in Carroll on your way home from work 
Welcome to the Bernie club 
Zach got the highest with trump! 
I'm a Patiño too then, it looks like 
I'm a commie too 
Let me be your VP 
McCoy! We are like the same 
That was my lowest 
13% similarity with rand 
isidewith.com is the website for that test if anyone is interested. 
Peoples choice not the big business' though 
No super PAcs 
I think o malley has a decent shot for the VP ticket. I liked what he had to say today 
91% Bernie, then 87% Biden, Clinton 84%
Did anyone take that test that aligns your views with the president that shares your views the most 
Agreed. This was much more civil and organized 
Hillary almost said what Bernie said, word for word 
Also, who new on your first day of congress you vote on legislations? 
Someone tell me how working ten hours a week will allow me to afford college 
Did you end up getting Fifa or pes?
So no 
It's on ESPN 
Red bull arena is empty...
Do you think he was injured or no 
Well I absolutely see the reasoning in that 
I see the reasoning in that I guess 
If Johnson is actually injured... that looks so bad on Klinsmann's part. 
What's everyone's take of Klinsmann vs Johnson...
They won't make the Euro's unless they score three goals 
What has happened to holland....
We lost to Baldwin Wallace 
Yep. 2-0
Was it yesterday?
Exactly. Then he looks bad and doesn't get call ups. U23 result wasn't good last week either...
You're right, Niel. I have no idea why I thought that. But Trapp isn't ready yet. He makes a lot of errors because he leads the MLS in attempted passing. Everything out of the back comes through Trapp. If Klinsmann wants to play him, play him in position and not left mid like he did against chile 
Bradley playing defensive is out of his position though. Klinsmann has tried that role before. He doesn't get as involved in the attack if he plays defensive 
Center*
Geoff Cameron should start every game for us as a scented back 
I liked our center back pairing for once, though 
Venturo Alvarado
Brooks?
 Joe Gyau 
We just don't look any better. I know our talent pool isn't the best. But don't promise so many things and not deliver
We'll be experiments that's for sure  
He is delusional in some aspects 
He said yesterday he thought it was an even game 
I don't think Klinsmann knows what to do at all
How many time did we spring Yedlin though. 
At least we didn't yesterday 
We don't have speed up top or on the wings 
We don't have the players do that either though. 
So is it our game plan? Or is it our players?
Look at these statistics 
MLS.com is ripping Klinsmann 
Is our talent that bad that we have to defend like that ? Why is that our game plan 
Defend the entire time
It looked like the World Cup 
I am so disappointed 
We are losing it 
What a douche move by oribe peralta
Ugly shot
The dank is in the building 
Geoff Cameron!!
Our best game in the World Cup was against Portugal... They went down a goal early and forced us to take it to them 
They are without two started too....
Yikes...
Shak�
Why does this feel like a World Cup game 
I am so nervous 
Were all those players on their prime for the World Cup? 
He wastes friendlies like no other 
Timothy chandler 
How many call ups do you give jermaine jones 
I agree. But he could have done a better job incorporating those players 
He is working with the same type of players as Bob did... If not better. Bob Bradley got fired for the same result, losing to Mexico in concacaf gold cup 
The young players have been in his development for how many years now? 
Yes I did 
The group chat picture is awesome 
It's an interesting lineup that's for sure 
What's the lineup everyone wants?
I agree. It sucks that bedoya is out 
I don't know if you're having problems at all 
Niel, if you get the group me app, it will work better 
Interesting 
Is Guzan starting? 
I'm nervous for this USA game 
Sweet 
I called him this morning and he mentioned watching it at our house instead of bills 
The soccer game 
Yes 
Craig, ask did if he is serious about pizza and the game
I'm on fall break
I'll see if my dad really wanted to get pizza and what not and I will let you know
I think my dad said something about getting pizza and watching the game if you wanted to come and watch it with us. Baylee will be here too. But that's up to you. I can let you what the plan is later if you're interested
Is Julie watching with you?
Where is everyone watching the game?
2-1 USA
Kent read, write, or play football
Swag
