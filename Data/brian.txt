😂😂😂😂😂😂
Talking about urinary incontinence in class and the professor starts talking about kegel's and everyone giggles then she goes "I'm doing them right now and you can't even tell!" 😂😂 
MESSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Anyone just see James' goal??
Poonslayer... when the going gets tough, quit. Has never failed me once you can't fail at something if you don't try
Write a strong worded letter how they are dumb and react is dumb
I can teach you that ez
Send nudes
Hahaha I'm feelin it
🔥🔥🔥
I always hated them no joke
I can call if you want
Your parents were yelling at eachother or your brothers were yelling at them after they broke the news?
You can't be serious
What????
😂😂😂😂 I freakin started watching with food and my mouth and almost had to spit it out!
Haha Anything to help! Not sure why people don't like it when it takes a second to do
Whenever! I'm watching 13 reasons why
Haha Nick we need your commentary!
@Nick Casto @Logan Patiño What are your guy's thoughts on playing RL with me and Zach?? We could even record it and we all get in chat or some talk app like discord
This is McCoy if we were to soccer golf in another neighborhood
Is it dope
The description of the 3 million view video: "A knight and a man who sells potions."
That's it 😂
I'm crying watching it!!
Guy in RL rn has the name Potion Seller and I died because that video nick showed us lol
I would have to watch a tutorial... google drive is for sharing things with other people
RT
How bad was the spill?
You poor man my life is on my Mac 😢
Who're
Let me know!
Logan and Zach too!
I'm playing now!!
PLAY WITH ME IN A PRIVATE MATCH!
That's like $8.75/hr but since you don't have to pay for food or housing with that 3.5k that's pretty good!
It's practically a job interview and 10 week networking event
I would do it for free lol
Congrats though that's insane how long is it?
Why wasn't I consulted before you accepted!?
YAASSSSS
Where at
Talk to me when you win a real title
Sick
The white guy
Wow
This game rn
I'll give it a look!
Not that I know of I looked on every channel
 But actually it's not on any of my channels so watching the Cavs making sure Kyrie keeps J Wall under control
Wait.. curling on NBCS.. someone keep me updated on the game
I was gonna ask if you wanted to play RL earlier but no one else was on
Nice!!
Game on actual TV?
I give you my blessing Nick
Don't think so
@Niel Skalican 
I would pound her
I could literally rest a plate on that booty and eat my breakfast off it
If every girl looked like that... 
WHO IS THAT
You got it mane! Turn off the basketball
What is it?
😂😂 I crack myself up sometimes
That looks amazing I would love to slap some butter on it and... well you know the rest...
Probably should learn how to bake a bit better don't ya think?
Umm.. anyone else noticing that dude is literally a human stirrup in the third picture.. you ask me he's the god
I am an educated white male and I understand nothing
Cinci always does well for their rank in March Madness
I hate you both right now
We're all hunting Bearcats on this blessed day
But I'm still going to root for UCLA
I have Cinci winning!!
Yeah it's sweet to see the highest level of college basketball but that bracket is what makes the difference between me watching all day or me just staying up to date
And this year is especially cool since everyone chose a different winner lol 
That's pretty much exactly it lol And if OSU is good then I watch them on TV when I can but not crazy enough college basketball fan to watch them if they aren't playing well.. I like NBA because it's way better basketball obviously since they're pros
Niel is next on the blocks let's see if he survives
THE DREAM SURVIVES
If Kentucky loses I want kicked from this group chat until the tournaments over so I don't have to face my shame
LoPa first to move into the Sweet 16
Hoe
Of everyone's teams I only have Logan and Julie's moving past this round 
Alright now it's judgement day for all of you!!
Michigan v Louisville
Kansas v Michigan St
Duke v SC
UCLA vs Cinci
Crew won
Galaxy won
Atlanta wrecked the Fire

nice.
Yep! I'm hoping for that
Dang.. honestly his last few albums weren't my favorite off the block but they always had to grow on me so let's hope
That's literally what David said
Nope :/ It wasn't on YouTube or Amazon music
Well everyone.. this is where I leave you.. 
Guess who never gets ice in his drink
What is it?
Nerd*
Need
^Literally why I picked them because I thought of you Nielson
Hahaha I picked WVU because I had to support Niel and West Virginia Tech
Cute
@Zach Spangler I'm really mad I have an exam Monday Tuesday and Wednesday or else it would've been sick to get on your server the second it opened!
Yeep
She was born here if that makes any difference.. they picked an American first name but a Vietnamese middle name kind of like you guys
Hahaha Welp
No middle name!? Emily has one 
It's a cool name how did she choose it?
Yeah but not her middle name then? 
Is Kire her middle name???
Kyrie
Making sure St. Patty's day didn't kill anyone
Is everyone alive?
Giving gifts on his own birthday? What a guy
I love jello
YES
Wow I'm jealous Julie only has Michigan winning 1 game
Top class 😂😂 Craig's finally got the jokes!
I'm dead
I realize I just said cheap and affordable 
Cheap, affordable, and you could stay with David!
tUT
Any other schools you're looking to transfer to
I would replace "stunk"
That sucks Craig I think it's fair to change for all incoming people but not those already promised
You scared Logan
That's your ticket to success Zach! Forget Ark the new thing is make up!
Hey I've thought of teaching too!! Like a hospital attached to a college which I could do both
Wowow I would never want to waste my time... that just doesn't sound like anything I want to go into especially for a job that will never challenge you after the first 3 years! Like 3 years in you would have seen it all and would have almost forgot all your clinical knowledge by 5 years in
YASSSSSS
I hate it! We shouldn't be let go because we want to further our education and work in a setting that will challenge us day to day.. plus there are definitely not enough hospital internships to go around for all pharmacy students who want residencies so we have no choice because to not have any pharmacy job basically means you're screwed
Dude Curtis said meijer is changing things around because they hate people having jobs then going residency.. I mean you would make bank but you would have no time to work.. 
As in March 2018
I apply in December and know by March
Haha Nah I have no clue yet! Nick imagine if you and I ended up in the same place and I did a PGY2
Win win win
Niel go to Arizona and then I will do my residency and live with you for my residency and then Nick will live with us when he does his residency
@Logan Patiño Who did Julie pick to win in her real bracket?? So far every one has someone different so that will decide it probably
He's practically asking to lose
😂😂😂
Jk 🤗
Woah woah why does Julie get two!?
I'm still at 0 points... since when do 12 seeds not win the first games
RIP Kennedy
So true
Yeah last year I barely even watched the tournament games lol
@Craig Casto 
Team name theme this year is rapper puns
Are you sure?
I was at bdubs today and watched the first 15 minutes of college basketball all year so I'm feeling good about St John's and whoever they were playing 
I'll play
I'm shocked..
Wtf!?
Zach
Heal your heart??
Umm
Nope leaving soon though
Nick you free tonight?
What you doing tonight ? 
Funny
State
I got excited McCoy then I realized you're in another store
😔
Well I'm coming home!
Who will be in Lancaster and free Saturday night??
SpangIndustries 
Totally forgot how much I like Bastille
I'll skype in so save some space for me
Having to make a decision is a good problem!? I could go my whole life without making a decision
Alright this isn't supposed to be an insult because we're proud of you Nielson.. but is Lexi going to have the final say or will you make this decision for yourself 
And that's sick!
Pittsburg is amazing David almost went there for pharmacy but didn't want to pay the price
Who crosses out the price Niel come on!
Seems like Arizona is giving you a lot of opportunity to reduce the out of state cost
That's hot
Aight so not worth me spending much time on lol
Anyone still play that Pokémon Duel game?
😂😂 
Classic
#SquadGoals
Probably because it's something you would do
^^just one leg I guess
We should've made the arms leg and body.. OP Exodia
And I'm dying explaining the GAF head to Emily hahaha

Bolt speedman

Logan remember those star wars unleashed games?? That's actually what he just downloaded I miss watching those for some reason
Anything that gets me off school I'm down
And 60 down??
My friend is trying to download a game in class for his laptop and he peaked at 1.1Mb/s
Jealous!!
Snowstorm!? It's sunny here
@poonslayer What did you say your wifi at MIT is? How many MB/s?

Blart
Wait.. Blart isn't Nick?? Wtf?
What's your favorite food Blart?
RIP
Got eem
Did you ask Lexi? 
I hate bicep tattoos probably my least favorite.. I advise getting a Mike Tyson before bicep
If that's actually a bet I guarantee I could raise the money
Well I'm not a tattoo guy so I already have my set view on them haha 
Are you getting it so people can see it visibly or where no one ever would?
Follow up.. so are you getting it to show others visibly or remind yourself where no one can see it
This is the greatest message of all time.. sorry Craig 
I would smash
I was just showing off my math skills nbd.. that sucks though I hate when they rush through slides
108 slides
Just coding nbd what you guys doing
Send me a post card when you're famous
Pretty sure that comment is gonna get 6 likes lol
Hey guys remember that one time McCoy posted a picture of Niel and his ex and he never responded to us because he's afraid to hear about his bad decision
Python
I would wear that hat
I too would prefer Prem I stay with it longer
Are there any head to head leagues for Prem? It's almost like doing both leagues in one
We've done the basics/genetics, hormones, infectious disease, cancer, and now neuro 
Hmm I wonder if we ever did GI
Should be "Remeron"
This class is so boring
He even keeps saying it
@Nick Casto Supposedly my medchem teacher things Zoloft is Zolofit 
Playing now actually
Truuu
Soccer is gay
😔
Shoot
That's what I thought you meant
I wanna be that pillow is what I want
Same
¡FELIZ CUMPLIRAÑOS, Mejor! Tiene un gran día. Te amamos ♥♥♥
Lvl2 pikachu waddup
So would you say it's worth downloading now or waiting till I can play more?
Just give me a Jolteon and I will beat it in a day
It looks a lot like clash royale 
So is that game something that you get stuff over time?? I have an exam tomorrow so I can download it after or today and let things build up
POKÉMON HEROCLIX!?!? HOW WAS I NOT AWARE OF THIS
Mine is ordered to come to Toledo 
Looks like you've been practicing your ball control
Craig it's your drug!
Remember when we made butter beer? Lol good times
Guys.. 
Oh god.. spring break
City's killin it
I now have 4 different professional groupme chats for school that people can see my beautiful avi pic
He's not wrong
SEND ME A POSTCARD BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW YOURE GONNA GET IT!!!
Hairy weiner
Come to Toledo first
Yeah I member
Yeah sorry Logan I can explain that if needed tho
Umm that would be too risky of a bet I would have to literally commit like the Friday before
I can only do things before June if that limits my availability for games
YES ONLY TAYLOR NO ONE ELSE
Craig wins
But let's remember that "ONE" time I was the guy who came between a relationship and I had all my sneaky ways and was always trying to get my foot in the door somehow and that's what he is doing.. now will it work.. no.. but is it annoying and can I predict every move from experience (unfortunately)... yes
Yeah Nick I feel bad for ya I feel everyone's opinions might be different because their experiences
Like my big thing is I'm not like getting emotional on you guys lol I'm more trying to be practical but I think I am 100% right and almost wondered if I'm not 
McCoy your input is the other thought in my head haha It's like I truly don't think anything will happen almost 100% sure other than him trying ridiculously hard and her probably just flattered by his embarrassing attempts but it's more me annoyed with her not telling me or caring what I said.. I have somewhat taken your mindset this far since this came up like 2 or 3 days ago and hasn't resurfaced because I'm just trying to not care but it puts those subconscious thoughts in my head like do I really have to say everything and anything I do anymore? Kind of annoying
Yeah asking price difference should be first before like getting too assertive
You feel me Zach... and Logan I agree with that too but like do I have grounds to be 100% right in saying no you can't stay with him
I suspect 0 cheating if I were her I would not do anything with him but it's uncomfortable and he will try to be flirty
Well okay now it's time to throw the last bit into the conversation I didn't want to throw her under the bus but she never actually told me... she was talking to someone else in our class who was going and said it and when they walked away I was like "umm"
I mean she's an only child and her parents are basically made of money
Yeah Niel you could be right!
Would you expect her to instantly understand and not do that?

Well I don't think she is at all interested in him and like I said I'm not threatened he is kinda weird but it's uncomfortable and she didn't care when I said I wasn't comfortable with it
Like take a more expensive room, let's say 500 instead of 400... split that in 4 and Emily is paying $25 extra dollars
Heck no lol 
Okay thank you sir so second part... I already told her I don't approve of it and I'm not comfortable... her excuse is it can save her some money (probably not much at all) and that I'm not going because I don't feel like spending $500
Alright I know bro opinions!
So there is a kid in the class below me (who I am not threatened by) who has tried to hit on Emily and even tried to convince her to leave me yet failed but now she is going to some meeting in San Francisco for an organization and he is too with two of his friends (1 guy 1 girl) and they are all going to stay in a hotel room together obviously she is sleeping with the girl but what are your thoughts on that?
AIDS? Bactrim
You will learn about so many and be taught all the horrors of resistance and super bugs coming from our negligence but doctors will continue to give pip/tazo or any other broad spectrum just to cover their butts... the system sucks
There are a billion of them man lol good luck 
#SummerInternshipSwagg
Spring Break: 4th-19th
Look who's the most cultured here
I would pay your parents my wifi and food bill for the past 10 years
But don't you think she would like pay everything off for Emily or something
I will high ball her and spread the wealth
"You're my last hope"
I met her once she came to our graduation! I introduced myself
Maybe if I write her a letter she will consider
But I'm her best friends boyfriend..... technically speaking if Emily and I get married then she will probably first or second woman in the wedding
50k to someone with 1 million dollars is 5%
50k to someone with 1.5 billion dollars is 0.0033%
For real...
Emily's friend is rich and just got 1.5 billion from somewhere and I'm like she literally could pay for all my stuff and a simple thanks would be enough
If one of you got 1.5 billion dollars today would you pay off the rest of our college debt for everyone in here?
Also what else would you do with it?
So I'm heading into Lancaster that way for an oil change but I wouldn't be leaving here for like 50 minutes ish is that fine?
Roads are sort of bad so drive slow
LEBRON PLAYIN
Waddup
If everyone can decide somewhat quickly 
Yeah but Craig can't tomorrow lol So it's whatever everyone else is feeling
So hang out tonight or tomorrow night? I gotta know so I can text my pharmacist back 
Shoot let's hope the "questionable" is just a saying.. I want to see Kyrie 
No way they have to play! 
Nah you're fine 
What time?
I'm in Cleveland for the Cavs game so I can't tonight
Nice! Pharm just asked me to work Friday 9-5:30 but I might say make it 10 and he's got a deal lol
Ye
Thursday night???
I'm in let's pick a night before it's too late! 
Oh dang never mind I will trade you
I only say tomorrow because the $5 movie night or else we would reschedule if you want and still could I guess if needed!
😢
Like if you're feeling River Valley Rogue One tomorrow at 7:10p!!
It was pretty insane
I take back my Bickle comment then but you should still come Craig!
😔
I thought he was going to family's house?? Craig you're invited!! You don't have to sneak away and give Shae Bickle the goods this year!
Aight I will eat then come
Who's at Logans already?
What time we getting pizza?
I only do PC gaming sorry guys that's I'm not so old fashion 
So everyone in this chat plus Julie will be there tonight??
Haven't played since last tourney
FOR REAL WTH
And are we hanging tomorrow night for New Years?
So is soccer golf tomorrow morning??
Oh it's tomorrow!?
Nice!! Gotta make it count we're never all together!
So that's 7/7 right!?
My jersey isn't here yet either but I'm cool to hang and for the SOCCER Classic!
😳😳
What did everyone get??
Craig you tried man.. that lady just sucks
7
Nick when do you take oncology? Still any thought on oncology specialty?
I had cancer on Monday :) I survived and had a complete response
Looks like tonight sucks!
Last final at 8am.. gonna need all the help I can get on this one!
Take it as you will everyone but my vote next year is to just do one fantasy.. A one time takes all focus the whole time then a down season
The struggle
I really gotta start playing

2 finals down, 3 to go
Finals week begins 😩
Say goodbye to our captain
Dang wish I was there
75.. just clenched the gold card
Neymar a 92 in FIFA 17 😳
Wait... that was about me I messed up my "your"... I'm embarrassed good bye forever guys
Craig come back when you're older than you're brother.. then we'll talk
Just keep trying Craig! 🤗
Nice avi loser
I've watched a few start up ark vids so I have some clue of what's going on
Nope! All in the boxes building once I get home
Ahh gotcha that's so true... well even if you pre recorded you can bring it so I can learn over break! Up to you!
Can you transport your PC home?
People just don't like the coaster vids they are all there for ark
I'm afraid you're switching to rust! I only will get one lol And Ark seems like my choice for now
Zach I'm currently watching your video
Nah they all look fine interaction wise.. I had to look up the Zonegran and Banzel but judging by it that person must have a huge seizure risk.. 
YES FAVORITE THAT TIMES 10 I just lost it in the middle of some students presentation lol
Look at Craig's professional photo.. you got Logan's as dog, me as a tomato, and Nick taking Logan's dignity away
Agreed, Craig don't make this a hostile environment
4 more for me as well
Two finals down!
Yeah I'm out :/
Make sure Craig is invited
@Niel Skalican 
@Craig Casto 
Like this message if you can commit to New Year's Eve morning! 4/7 members liking means we do it
New Year's Eve morning or New Years morning?
My pharmacist wants my availability by 4
Let's get a date so I can cal off work
If we can get a vote ASAP so I can tell my pharm
Dang.. so many just leave it the 24th? Or try the 23rd when you're here??
I need to text my pharmacist for when my working days can be
Also when is Christmas classic happening?
I got picked for the APPE block I want but it goes from June-September
I don't think I will be able to go on a vacation this year
I have bad news everyone
Dang boi! I don't have one yet!
It's about that time to start crunching all the numbers for what I need on these finals!
Wow that's too bad.. really hoping everyone else is fine
17th maybe?
I'm not fake
Bro I'm just being me
Speaking for myself, I know I do
The Facebook thing is basically a talk about guns of course
I'm watching a live stream Facebook thing
What!!! 
Any update?
I'm on google now looking that's insane is it still going on I can't find super recent updates
That's pretty neat!
Confused
😔😔😔
😂😂 No worries I will be there soon
Did you tell them their turn is up in 4 minutes?
How long they there? 
@Logan Patiño Is anyone still at your house?
I'm leaving soon!
👍🏽👍🏽
So 7pm works?
That's cool tho you can have the music room 
Bro night these days comes but once a semester!
I can stay up as long as everyone else does
Uber everywhere
I'm thinking ping pong, pool, FIFA, and hot tub
You bet!
CRAIG
I'm going tomorrow!
AYYY
¡¡¡¡¡¡
Name?
Julie might be there
McCoy are you sure that's not a fake address?
What's the address?
Logan the only time I've seen you happier than a hole in one on an arcade game is the time you saw a bird... I worry sometimes
@Craig Casto You coming Friday?
Doritos are Doritos I'll eat them all! Could be cool tho! 
If he supplies some sweet chili Doritos he's got my vote 
Wait I haven't heard anything from Craig the Crippler is he coming?
He could always replace McCoy that's about all he's good at 😘
Is he good at ping pong, FIFA, and hot tubbing?
NJ?
You're good how'd it go?
So is it a Friday night sleep over for sure?
That's one idea
You won so you pick how we do the tournement for the belt! Like last year it was the three transfers to a 4 star team
@poonslayer You're responsible for the planning of the FIFA tourney this year! Make me proud!
Haha Okay well tell him to come over Friday! 
He comin to bro night?
Can we do Friday night?
So when we hanging out over thanksgiving?? Everyone propose a date so I know how to plan my time home
I hear Federer won the Open with one of those
Aight
Julie J
Ur girl 
Sent ✅
I forgot lol
Told you all he's the next big thing
Totally agree it's easiest for me to look at it from a standpoint of not supporting either of them.. I read last night more about why we even need the EC and I guess it does make sense to regulate votes based on region but I also agree it greatly depreciates the value of one's individual vote yet doesn't render it "useless" so I see everything better from both sides and started understanding things more this election
Pic from Facebook 
My grandparents are like 100% trump and all they talk about is he will stop abortion so I can see the >45 stats if they can generalize that population
Those NY times numbers are very interesting! It's funny how everything almost looks in favor of Hilary but whites outnumber everyone so much that all he needed was that one stat
For sure! Next election I might be done with school stuff to invest some time lol
Hahaha Agreed that's so true!!! 
Wow it's 12:30... I've had this on for like 5 hours
I'm afraid we are changing for the worse what if this becomes a trend and either of them endorse some other under qualified person
You are not wrong sir
Especially with someone as crazy as him that is dangerous! 
He wins Pennsylvania in the next few min he for sure your new pres
Crazy how close this is I went into today almost 90% sure Hilary had it in the bag
Good point....... 
Evan McMullin 4 Utah!!
But if I voted third party what difference would it have made? Gary Johnson go from 2.9% to 2.90000000001%? Not trying to be sassy but for this election I hate both candidates and relying on the difficulty to pass things through congress to buffer them out
I'm watching the election coverage! That counts!
McCoy we will all chip in $5 to help you get home if you at least consider
I will be home Wednesday night but work early Thursday so my availability is Thursday night
Jerseys you have
Teams/players you like/dislike
Size
Sleeve length
Who previously got you
Who you previously got

All to JULIE by Friday!

Let's have a cut off of when everything needs to be in
GET EVERYTHING INTO JULIE
Well my uncle asked about a ping pong paddle place but are we doing the exchange? If so sooner than later aka like now
Thanks bruh I couldn't remember
What's the China site we use to order jerseys???!
Are you guys watching this!?!?
@Logan Patiño @poonslayer where u at?
That's awesome though!!
I'm so mad we had to cancel :/ The meeting was really beneficial though so I had to!
WATWATWATWAT
This was a great season for all of us
Wait... it's over? Lol
😏
Nick I gotta say you're the only person I know how babes are literally lining up for
ONFG THAT WOULDVE BEEN PERFECT NICK
 Not helpful!
Pumpkin carving ideas!?
Guy on the left is given me that look
That's pretty neat!

I've slowly become the same way
Sweet! Please!!! And good work!! Are you a good public speaker?
Bro write down other people's topics for me!! I have to find a summary article for the class below me and I need more obscure topics with a good RCT or something on them!
GOOD LUCK!!
I spy a plain white mug
I'm coming to your actual seminar!!
At least we're beating Chicago :)
Ola >>> Kei
Thanks LoPa! I got it now
Probably not 😔
Anyone know if the crew playing on a channel I would have?
OMFG THIS ONE HAS A BLUE LOGO!!!
Then he isn't even a real drake fan.. probably likes the lyrically genius "Started from the bottom" and probably still thinks the song title is "started from the bottom now we're here"
Represent my 1% heritage
Haha I accept defeat
There we go! Logan gets it!
I'll be sure to keep you guys posted on all his jokes to come!! Stay tuned!!
"Torsades de pointe.. everybody wants that it's sexy! Nobody wants to be in a hospital and say Oh I have PAT w/ block" 😂😂 IM LTERALLY DYING
I want to be this guy! He's our kinetics teacher, works in the ICU, and there is an abnormal EKG on the white board from my cardio class yesterday and he just looks at it and goes "Oh, Mobitz 2!" And simply calls it out and keeps going he's genius
Look at that beauty
Sorry to hear that McCoy :/
Guys I just gave myself a fake insulin injection.. Like legit needle just had normal saline
SERIOUSLY!? That's awesome!
😂
Dr. Ohlinger
And that's the Microsoft word style option 
Casually holding his mug and teaching us pharmacokinetics... What a man
RIP
Recitation is a joke skip it
McCoy how's the Pokemon go up at MIT?
Because that picture you're in!?
It's the little things
Logan first can we take a moment to assess how genuinely happy you look after that hole in one? It's almost comparable to the bird from hackathon
THE MUG
I'm part of something now it's really simple measuring the "grit" vs performance in a Drug Lit class but I'm not sure if that will be a paper most likely a poster presentation at events
I wish I had a publication under my name it looks amazing for any resume/CV
That's awesome! When do you know what lab work?
McCoy my message didn't send yesterday because I have no service only wifi in the lab and with non iPhone I have to have service
I never reveal my sources 
So Nick you the APhA IPSF Junior Chair? Nice ;)
Mine are America
Send pics
But did you die?
I would say the stacked team has done what's expected of them yes
Pep >> Hart
Wrecked a charizard
Dang a full page over 1000! I just checked and I have 74 on the pokedex
Dang you're really moving up quick! Send your top Pokemon
With a lucky egg I can get to 55/75 experience needed to go to Lvl22
Level 21 as of today
Isaac my roommate lol
Just walked through main campus for 2.5 hours with Isaac and got like 18k just for catching Pokemon and poke stops and caught around 90 total
Don't feel bad Nick i wouldn't force anything
Details...?
I put it on after the game lol I put it on when I sent the pic
@Niel Skalican 😘
He left the room during our break and he brought the mug
It's just so beautiful like who has a plain white mug that literally holds like 2 sips of coffee 
You can see it there it's just so simple and beautiful
My professor has this plain white one cup coffee mug that I've never seen him without
Goodluck at MIT McCoy don't miss us too much 😘
God forbid*
Whether*
If I had the time I would I think David went to a few practices or something
http://youtu.be/oWK1b4ECMak 😘
Bear trap went off but there's no one there!
Watching the last Tranger Things right before bed might not be a good idea
Where you at Kei!?
@poonslayer When do you leave for MIT?
YEAH FRIG OFF!
Wait..

Gotta love these types of people
I'm sore
Yeah
Monica in Silicon Valley is in She's the Man
Park either at Logans or behind my car
Watching some She's the Man now but switching over at 10
Mine or we sneak into their's, steal food, then come back here your choice
Well Nick if you want to watch at 10 or anytime after or just enjoy your breakfast I'll be here watching
Like straight to the final?? How would that work in a bracket?
That way everything is competitive how we wanted
Or just play 5 teams and all games go to 25
David's partner is confirmed so with your parents we do have 6 teams
Is something happening with Pipa?
Do we have enough people yet?
They're insane! I was looking into "throws" and "catches" and I think it's anything that isn't clean off the palm and fingers flat
Also if I were to block a hit and it came on our side then we have 2 hits remaining and I am allowed to touch it next
If there is both teams touching it simultaneously at the net and it falls to my side then I get 3 hits still
If the ball is on the other side I can reach to block it ONLY after they made contact so think of it like pass interference in football the where they have to touch it then you can hit
USA USA USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Wow world record in men's 100 breast stroke by Great Britain 
Men's USA beach volleyball at 3pm
I'm eating and drinking coffee
What's back?
If Niel overslept let's push this back a bit!
Kill me no sleep
Which I'm tempted to do anyway to enjoy my coffee and not be up by 7 lol
I just need confirmation before I sleep soon and if not I am heading to the Patiño house between 10-11 with a 9:30 alarm
So I just got home and probably sleeping in my own bed for the night but I too would like to know some plans for tomorrow because if something is going down at 8 I need to be aware
Just listened to adventures of Bobby Ray for the past hour
Like I would know that lol
Good dick will do that 😂😂😂
McCoy I'm still laughing at your comment 
Past sunset :/
¿?
And...?
Get it boi
Just let me know what we doing! 7am is not my favorite I would say let me have some sleep
I like your idea Logan and early is fine with me on Saturday
Danggggg
A week day would be way better because the people and yeah an end of summer weekend will be packed
Like a weekday but work gets in the way
I mean.. We're basically loosing money if we don't go
Also you know how prescribing birth control is becoming the next big thing? Well all my grandpa can talk about and sends me emails of articles are things like the conscience clause of not having to dispense birth control if it's against my beliefs and in my head I'm like "it's the 21st century bruh"
Mhm! I love the increasing role of pharmacists but maybe this isn't the best thing
Sorry I texted that before I left work! I think it has its positives because wouldn't you want your kid or a loved one who accidentally overdosed or something to be saved but what I really don't like is it's basically an excuse for any opioid addict to go too far because they know it's just a drive into the nearest pharmacy to get it reversed
Nick your take on our narcan dispensing rights?
One more day right??
@Niel Skalican @Zach Spangler Sand volleyball tournament Sunday August 7th starting mid afternoon or so 
@Logan Patiño 107.9 the sickest radio mix rn tune in with DJ Snake
"Pretty chill" 😂
How was the trip!?!?
You guys driving now?
100% fake
Magmar
That's sweet! I did jetskis for the first time in Maumee and they were pretty fun they're so fast at accelerating and turning
I'll pack you some sandwiches
Yes please
U kno it
Traffic won't arrive till game time 😑
Toronto trip sounds freakin awesome and if it's a thing next summer by chance and I'm free then count me in
I'm not entirely sure about everything
No clue but it should in the near future f it isn't now since its on the main website
There's a way to change teams once if anyone is coming over to Instinct
What's the wildcard mean in fantasy?
Volleyball Tournament August 7th at Logan's house
Find and confirm a partner everyone in here is obviously invited
Lancaster is drowsy city
Nice boy that machop is still sweet 
That EEVEE IS INSANE!
However you do have your time in that picture as a nurse would
I don't believe it
Don't believe it
YOU PLAY!?
Who's is that??
For now keep upgrading
:))) We will own carrol!!
I think they will add it where you can join a different team
I am seeing that online
Maybe in the future they will let you change
I went yellow since Nick already was Lvl5!
Wow
@Zach Spangler Zach you need to get Isaac into Poke Go and we can take the gym in Carroll together all four of us
Dis boi 
Leaving
New time! McCoy we leave at 5:30!
What time will you be able to get there Craig?
YESH
I'm wearing gym shorts
Par 3
I'm wearing shorts and a tee
Golf at 5:30 with me McCoy and Nick
Aight we can leave at 5:15 McCoy
Is @Craig Casto coming? And @poonslayer when do you want to leave? I can drive
Is Craig coming? I'm going to eat first
We would end up leaving probably in 30 minutes
Today
@poonslayer 
I know McCoy is going to the gym at some point
I work 9-5:30 tomorrow so I will probably be sleeping at my house but I probably only need to be back at my house around 12.. If we meet from there I can delay my haircut and McCoy and I drive together
I have to get a haircut but I can plan to meet everyone there if we get a time!
I don't know a Kelly Hoffman and are we actually doing it!?
😂😂😂😂
Hmm... Let's go Red or Blue Squad
What are my options?
Lvl4
Craig get the game
Or should I wait for more?
That's what I plan
So press transfer on my bad pidgey?
Dang nice to know!
Cute
What does CP mean and what should I do with a pudgy?
Load
lol
Bro mine won't even old
Lit.
Watching the end of 8 mile.. It's lit
If everyone is down!
I like coffee
New wallpaper
Gay.. I was excited
I downloaded it and chose Charmander but now I can't even get back on because the servers
Haven't even been able to start!
You got the game!?
Downloading now...
My ideal deck was always all evee evolutions and that's it
I don't know if I should believe Craig or not
Haha 4 years straight I miss and I didn't even make it to Vacation this year
Yeah every year..
I work Saturday till 5:30 so probably will miss out on Nick's gpa's thing since we are moving Paul into his new place that day
I could go any time if you had a chance to join
I would be down for after 5 just a thought
With McCoy 
I was going to say Par 3 golf
Nick and Craig do you guys work this Friday?
😑
@Nick Casto  I'm trying to get Curtis to get Google wallet and pay you for both tickets right now
He's wondering how much per ticket and what section and if you can get anymore
They only have mine posted till the 16th
I'm not ignoring you I'm like 5 minutes from work to check the schedule lol
Who is the 5'8 kid we signed?? Any potential?
Same
Why?
I work that day
That's better
I lost track of this discussion... I will like all the messages I agree with
Game, set, match
Goodness why is everyone bitter
Yeah Tampa is pretty good
Niel, shut up.
I think half the time people know we don't have the audacity to call them out
I mean it's just so clean and perfectly executed
Zachary we call that tachycardia
Really!?
Mac and I go way back
I'll try my bestest!
9-5:30
I work but when I work this Friday I will mention to Nick to attempt to get someone to take it!
Ayo Nick! When is your Gpa's party!?
I was sad seeing Hungary lose... They were playing better all game but couldn't finish with a 1-0 and then the end Belgium scored 3 quick
Thought I would let you know :)
Yeah!!!
Nick I judged worked with Kelsey from ONU! She say she know you!
Steven Seagal
Chile manager
Fun af... Adds a whole new aspect I liked it
PLAYING SEAFARERS
YASSSSS ME TOOOOO
July 1st! Sleep over Saturday maybe!
YOU KNOW ME BOI!!! IVE BEEN DYING TO COME FOR 5 YEARS IF I CAN MAKE IT I WILL MAKE IT!
Shakiri is so sticky it's hilarious to watch
Watching now but they haven't shown a replay
I'm not :/
Scratch what I said.. Style points over all
I need to adopt a more conservative play style since I don't get to play as much nowadays and my stamina isn't the same lol
With Chile's 7-0 win I think this final could be good just unfortunately I would prefer the 3rd place match to be the final lol
Argentina is insane tho..
Watching the highlights from last night since I was studying for my final and Messi is insane we just couldn't keep up at all
I want to stream it
"Sloshing"
WHAT!?!?!?
Not me and yes
Hahahahahahahahahahaahahaha
Hahaha Bussy!?
@poonslayer
Please tell me your thoughts on this tumblr post
No but I have this
Hahaha Yes!!!! That's amazing!
Such a perfect way to describe it
YES!!!! He was awake but we didn't know 😂😂😂
Definitely watch JR's press conference! Shows the real JR not the one depicted in media
LOVE MY CITY!!!! Best day ever this is so unreal!!!!
Okay cool this will be interesting
Can I still play with you guys if I'm way behind?
Dang!! Imma be 2 weeks behind!!
F ME
F ME FORGOT A GAME IS ON
Maybe after school ends!
Nerd
Need
Question... What kind of game is runescape? Do we all play together online? And is it worth it?
Ball is life 
Low key wanted someone to shank him on his walk back
WHAT A GOOD NIGHT
Sameeeee
HERE WE GO
I am seeing this long game though with the fouls on their top players
I gotchu Craig I see it too
Cavs blowing this lead
Umm I liked him last game but he definitely plays scared and doesn't have that factor that lets him beat defenders
USA USA USA USA
Dang Kyrie is burning Curry already!!
Yeah but the atmosphere you'll be in would make the game 5x better
Luv u
Quick what is a streaming website!?
Male
Nah Kyrie
If I wasn't in school I would
Tampa 1-0 Cinci
Crew 4-0 Tampa
Cinci >> Crew <- Niel logic
#1 fan 😂😂
She means well hahaha
Thank you Logan I was afraid you would be mad but as long as you laugh then this was a success 😂
I feel mean but it is funny
https://www.facebook.com/SPORTbible/videos/1985558394923016/
Is this Julie or is it Julie!?
A trash can
I would pay $0 and expect a nice salmon dinner before the concert
100% agree I've probably seen some of those same videos.. Rapping is about auto tune and publicity
Good point
I would almost be afraid of the truth
Omg so true lol
I would go to Drake for a reasonable price
Not me
Sounds like a 21st birthday if you ask me!
Whatcha got planned??
Happy Birthday LoPa! 🤗🎂
Soo... USA #1
Your girl outta town and this kernel is staying with yall because it got kicked out. What you gonna do?
How's vacation so far!?!?
Did you pass Zach?
Do I just go to FS1.com or what!?
Have you guys been able to find USA and other Copa streams?
Wow McCoy you don't last long
Gettin it ;)
Get subway!!
Dang you close!!!
If it's meant to be then she will be there
Make sure Craig talks to the red head this year that's all I ask
No way!! So jealous
DO YOU GUYS LEAVE TODAY!?
That's true! Which I believe they will and tbh if we get out I am happy enough!
There's such a huge difference in the first touch between teams
That was a bad game I don't think we played well
Nah Bedoya kicked the ball 20 miles above the goal
WHAT A STRIKE
A few chances but set pieces have been insignificant and our best chance was a 25 yard shot by Dempsey
If we get dead last and lose all three then I will agree
Agreed
2-0 Yedlin handball resulting in James' PK goal
Hmm... Thoughts on handball?
Your Colombian anthem
McCoy and Logan do you guys know your national anthem by heart?
SHOUT OUT TO KICK NASTO FOR THE SICK JERSEY TO REP MY COUNTRY!
Who's stadium is this? Football I'm assuming?
GUESS WHOS GOT FS1!!! THANK THE LORD
Sometimes I wish you dead
Just checking if I'm dumb but USA plays tonight right?
Nice! So predicted to like it more than nationwide?? 
Logan how was your first day??
How much time?
Wait so when do we know if Crew play FCC?
Like I e never heard of them before
Are they a new team?
Haha So hate FCC is what I'm understanding here lol Another one of Niel's things to be different and think he's the heart and soul of Cinc"I"
Haha I don't know why FCC is a topic of discussion that's what I'm wondering lol
Is everyone a Cinci fan now? I think I will keep to the Crew
I was going to pick him up but he was 8.1!
Yeah they probably weren't happy about that but who cares
Nervous??
Logan does your internship start today or tomorrow?
So jealous! Yeah I'm definitely in
How was golf??
Haven't gone in over a year
Gosh dang it I hate all you I want to so bad
Jealous
And Niel captained Kei Kamara 😂😂 What a has been!
Umm... Logan just came back on McCoy??
About time our table looks proportionate
So far everyone winning this week is the underdog!
Craig wants it
Why is crew delayed??
I'm looking at them now and Nick and Craig are neck and neck and you and McCoy basically are too
About to take 4th place again after this week
This is Logan
Saw that one coming
HARD STICK
"I dare Ronaldo to go kiss Carasco's girlfriend right now" hahaha New favorite commentator whoever said that
But RONALDO
RONALDO FOR THE WIN
Yep... Fifth
They play it so safe!
Ronaldo probably wanted fifth shot
I sortve want Ronaldo to get one last award but as a team I want Atleti
😑
Who is everyone cheering for btw
Did you guys hear Alexis lalas before OT talking how if he heard the potential best player in the world was plying in this game he would expect at least one moment of brilliance? 
And did some creepy tongue thing
Pepe should have at least a yellow for two simulations where he rolls and holds his face
Now Modric is a boss.... His passes are so beautiful
When's the last time Ronaldo or Bale did something?
😳
Youre welcome
It's my channel 12 if that helps
I actually have it on my cable
DALÉ
I know who they should've got...
I'm banking on Ronaldo just going off in the beginning giving him the confidence he needs to wreck and go with the flair
Who watching the final?
Yea true I guess for starter clubs I would look for cheap and all the same brand/set
I say buy clubs fit for your height and clubs you can feel comfortable with! So before you guys get some make sure to test them out and be happy with them
Ma man ;)
It's the eyes that got you amirite?
Zach there are more important matters at hand rn
Pics 
Yee 
Actualy he said his foot is messed up
I think he's home already
Tell Robby D I say what up 🤘🏽
When everyone is out playing soccer and you're studying platelet disorders 😔
He's got probability control in a later click
I realized.....
Come over to Tottenham
I would help...
And it was awesome! Two 90 degrees drops and they make you hang over the edge before releasing you
Front row Valravn babeeeh
I always wondered why professionals in 2v2 sand volleyball never go for the dinker and now I know
YES NO GAY DINKERS!
I knew that was coming screw you Craigery!
Craig you better mean me
Thanks guys! Going with Raheem the Dream today
D-FENCE WINS GAMES CRAIG
I know! Like what the heck who spends that much and goes through all that for just my birthday! My parents don't! Lol
This event is so boring omg
Deal :)
Jealous
Wow
SOA-CAO-TOA!!! 😂😂😂😂😂 still laughing at that 
Hey Niel my Pride team went like 13-1 one year!! We probs could wreck the Crew!!
David and I are home 
+ spike ball
I won't be here for my birthday though
I think I am going to eat with the family for my birthday tonight around 6ish
Wednesday is my last night in the 740 boi
I'm a better hiker 
March Madness is a thing?
Oh.... Wyatt seems to think you only need above a 2.0?
And is it different than what you need to stay in the program?
Nick what do you have to keep in ONU pharmacy to graduate?
YESSSS
Or "as all Cleveland fans say"
As all great fans say: there's always next year
Wowow
I just saw the score thinking they already knew they couldn't win but keep their spot
IT DROPPED THEM A SPOT!?!? WOWOWOWOWOW 
Also underrated
Underrated 
Wtf?
😔
☺️
Does she hate me?
Haven't read anything but as long as it is here I am happy
Send pics I don't have a Twitter 
Don't say his name
Eh
And a bad attitude
Paul said we got money and a first and second round pick
Look for 4 defenders worth 75k a piece and keep Parkhurst for a substitute
See I will take the money... Buy a new defense 😂
How much did we pay him and how much did we get?
That's all I am hoping for!!!! My whole philosophy outside of his attitude is make money off him while the old man is still worth something
NE Revolution!
See ya later Kei!! 
Last night we went through two boxes of wheat thins, a box of cousin willies, ice cream, 4 turkey burgers and buns, McCoy made two chicken breasts, made pancakes, omelettes the past two mornings and then I come home and take a fourth cup of my mom's "gluten" free granola stuff and she flips.... This is why the sleep overs don't take place at my house lol
Yeah
Zach 😢😢😢😢
Guess who's back?
I have a passport!! It's just about my availability but Toledo is already half way there in a way!
Hahha I was going to say Passports are very official documents you won't get that in a week
Technically I just finished my four year degree 😳😳😳😳
 IM DONE
Send pics
I wonder if closer to the time we find a meeting point to drive there
Are you Lakewood or west lake?
I'll be in Euclid, OH from the 25th of July to August 9th I think
Wait actually Nevermind I will be coming from Cleveland area from an internship
Haha It's like a win-lose but I mean I know what the right choice is here! Maybe my dad lets us take the excursion up so everyone can ride together! It fits 8!
So.... To unfortunately hit you guys with some bad but good news... As you all know my birthday is May 20th and as you all know Paul's birthday is June 8th so as a combined gift and they brought David in as well my parents bought us tickets around the half field line about 13 rows up.... Since Curtis bought a ticket too I think his cousin is buying mine from me 
👍🏽
How much is each???
Hey Nick do I still owe you for mine and Curtis' tickets?
It won't post!!

Dang!! Logan has an awesome in!
NO WAY!!! Dang you guys do it a year earlier than us!!
Btw everyone.. I now officially can give everyone their immunizations
Oh my bad I did say free lol
Free? They are 37 including tax lol Which saves $35
I'm gone all through late May and June so just an offer for free tickets.. If we get enough people then I'm all in but it's up to you guys
I could do between the 10th and 19th
For any time in May
When are we going to Cedar Point? Today is the last day for $30 tickets
Sum 41 is like one of Paul's favorite old bands and they may have changed their name
All the sudden I've presented like 3 times in the past month
Do you guys ever have to present in front of your class??
I was going to say! We learned that this year Emily was impressed you knew that!
That gon be me someday
Who here still likes watermelon after realizing it looks like an ascites patient's stomach
My girl works it on the weekends
Use your words McCoy.. You got this
It begins
What's Dean lost qualification?
Not sure about that Niel!
That's just for now!!! And it's a class with multiple finals in different areas so I need an 89 average on them all
Yeah just took a final... Already know I missed 2 points 😑
Niel has two wins..... Both against me
Just followed Jim Stopani on Facebook and he literally has a bunch of videos that are so helpful!! Like who knew the tricep kick back as awkward and non engaging as it is is actually one of the best tri work outs!
KICK NASTO FOR THE WINNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!
Dis them back!
I found a new shout at Hong Kong Buffet
Yeah Craig she also does stuff with TB!!
Haha You're exactly right Poonslayer!!! Like it's all about prevention and detection and just how insane would that be!!!
So much more interesting than studying PPIs leading to C. Diff lol
Not saying I wouldn't apply to join that lab...... I would be all about that!
My new MedChem teacher is from MIT and she was telling us how people in the lab above her at MIT studied biological weapons and we're looking into Zika as a weapon 😳
4/20
Haha He's beating Niel tho
I have Cash app :)
Random though: Craig I still owe you $4 for pizza... Don't let me forget
Dumbbb
A tie!?!?
Not looking good for me...
https://media0.giphy.com/media/xTiTnBVEew0rLWXXqw/giphy.gif
How many points off the bench coming?
How much??
Seriously??
Dang now I'm worried!!!
Well I captained Castillo also so it's based on Urruti and Dwyer against my Dia (SKC Defender)
Oh shoot!!!
Dom Dwyer needs to pull around 10 points for you to win Craig!
And currently Niel is living up to his reputation 8-40
28-19
Currently Nick may be leveling the scores in MLS
I only shed one tear
I thought I was the chosen one but there was only so much I could do in 5 weeks... I made the executive decision last night as I chose sleep over managing my line up
I am sorry to all of my supporters, but I hereby declare myself dropping out of the race to beat McCoy in fantasy this year. It has been a fun run 😪
Wait is Craig actually doing that to his car?
That's awesome!!! About time we get some drama going!!
Just talked to someone about Black Cherry keyboards
I played to day with medical students and I think I counted 5 megs and messed up 2 so 5/7
Craig I respect you so much more I didn't know he was your favorite too!!
Second favorite player to ever play the game! Only to Tmac
Same.. I have two class presentations tomorrow but no way I missed this
Best possible way to remember him
Wowow
Carrying the Lakers like the last 20 years!
I LOVE THIS MAN
I could never miss this!!! It's insane!!!!!
I am!!!!
Craig I gave you a 4 point lead because my substitutions.. Better take advantage
It just goes to show
https://www.facebook.com/GeeksterInk/videos/1080983495273810/
@poonslayer 
May 20 I move back I think
I be home 2nd week of May or so
🙋🏻 pleasant valley
Oh wow they just bashed on Yedlin hard for Vardy's first goal and well deserved too
Jk
I was literally coming back into group me to say except the goalie lol
Sunderland just gave up with like 10 minutes left in the game.... Almost embarrassing to watch I hope they get relegated
Go ahead
CREW SC BABY!!!! WE DA BESS!
Still have this shin splints? :/
Ur hot
Thanks boo 😘
Of course I forgot to trade out Keane 
No :/ I wish... It would be fun between all us though
SERIOUSLY!?!? My gosh I never knew this I just played the first time last night
It's fun af
😑
WELL DO YOU OWN IT!?!?
YOU KNOW IT!?
Anyone ever hear of a board game called Catan???
Play the first 2 moves of heroclix 
In that case if you guys don't mind I might drive down to chill for 15 minutes or so
Pics
How are everyone's manbuns coming?
Either way that's kinda sweet! You could join the crew and annoy Logan and McCoy with drug talk 👍🏽
No shame in that though! Money is money
Like some manufacturers research and invent/create their own drugs and make a patent for them and others just make the cheaper generics which are the exact same and market them once the brand name patent expires
Hope that turns out though! What would you do for them???
I think they're the type to just put out a bunch of generics and get rich lol
Ye
We actually were forced to and got classes cancelled to be there but I would've probably gone anyway it only happens at places like once every 7 years or so! So basically lucky
Second person was applying for intern license but stole a phone charger so they had to go through all the crap to give him his license 😑
PharmD
She just got sentenced to 5 year probation and has to go to PRO (pharmacist rehabilitation organization) for that time but she still has her license so she's lucky and probably because she wasn't under the influence at work
Currently at a pharmacy hearing where this girl could get her license revoked for alcohol and heroin abuse
Keane is out which hurt me
Nick our game was embarrassing... When I logged on just now I saw how horrible my team did like 2s and 3s everywhere but then turns out we both did haha
Deli Alli just joined the F2 freestylers and now they call themselves F3!
Exactly.. Like that's the perfect word
So like Megan Trainer is chubby but not fat.. I don't know how to categorize
AND PAYET'S FREEKICK 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
SECOND AND FOURTH***
WHO SAW MAN CITY'S FIRST AND SECOND GOALS
Dang Craig ;)
Anyone know the time of the game?
And yeah I think they would almost be on eternal strike if that's their plan
If they charged more money (team/manager pays them more money) then their sales won't catch up and almost every team will go under
How many tickets are you able to get?
Let me see her
No I did not!
The Bickle again?
Who's your bae Craigy?
👍🏽
Yessir
^Curtis
🙋🏻
Will do!
Nick when should Curtis know by?
($11)
Could I get 0.0055% ownership please?
By tonight I will tell him to make up his mind
Curtis might be buying one but he isn't decided
I'm still in whenever I set up Google wallet I will send it
🙋🏿
I just feel there's a difference between the surface and say 3 inches in for my case (jk this is not for me asking to do it but the 3 inches is correct)
So it's like a shower before kind of event? What about all up in there
Learning about bacteria and the idea came up of anal and I'm curious the group's thoughts on how long one would wait between having anal and the girls last poop
On the game
What's the date?
Collecting 20 of those stupid things in oblivion had me so underpaid
Nirnroot cures cancer it's a fact
Just think... 7 hours non-stop alchemy
I feel like running from my responsibilities and playing Skyrim
Adventures of Bobby Ray and Finally Famous albums for studying = heaven
And yeah McCoy has 2015 Fifa belt and SOCCER Classic! Can't let him own 2016!
I have a lot of trades too it's just about my captain picks
Hahaha I'm trying to hard!!! This past week I set myself up for it
I just need Niel to win lol A 4-0 start for McCoy is getting away too quick 
I have Castillo just because he has a double game week
Obviously you know my captain but honestly that captain pick scares me a bit because typically when Giovinco plays well he scores close to 15 
@Nick Casto Can I know your captain?
Craig that's beautiful! 
Craig averages just shy of 60 a match but just can't get it lol Consistency will pay off though
McCoy I truly am sorry but I am cheering for Nielson
Some good match ups this week! If Niel can pull an upset like he did on me, tie breaker between Nick and me, and if Craig beats Logan there will be a 2 or 3 way tie for last
He does all the car singing things
He's so funny.. Maybe one day you guys will catch on lol
😞
Who likes James Corden?
Just remember in anatomical position the penis is erect
CRAIG WITH THE GRAMMAR CORRECTION 🙀🙀🙀🙀
@Craig Casto The song Kevin on Macklemore's new album is good and so real.. Nick would understand it
Zayn's new album: 👍🏽 or 👎🏽
Dang you Niel I wanted to pass you
Who has Duke over Oregon and TAMA winning tonight?
I gotcha.. And Alex and I thought Mia would be funny
Honestly I was able to predict probably half of all your picks.... Only thing I was shocked by is Jennifer Lawrence not in McCoy's
Hard to do mine....
1. Brittany Snow (It's just gotta be)
2. Emma Watson
3. Ariana Grande
4. Anna Kendrick
5. Shakira

Honorable Mention: Mia Khalifa
@Niel Skalican I LOVE AND RESPECT YOUR REESE WITHERSPOON PICK
Can someone find out what tickets cost??
Hahaha Like she's some random girl in pharmacy
Do I correct her?
Possible scores are all quite close!
By 4 points brah! But all the games were within 5 points this week!! I'm excited for this fantasy! The BPL is closer than ever too
Hahaha That's why I want them out!
Also Nick can you kick Merseyside and Red Devils for me? They don't play
DID NICK CASTO JUST TAKE FIRST PLACE THIS SEGMENT!? 
I have like a week or two right when summer starts that I will be home!!
Love you
McCoy is deciding factor
Except Logan and Niel good job 
Wow to all of you
You're all liars
Who here flosses regularly?
Hahahaha Nick the celebration made it 😂
You guys have Dayton or Syracusev
The only thing I saw was "oh Arizona has a team to shock people and go far" so I put them to elite 8 and they lose by 10 first game
School is my captor 😞
Dang Microsoft word is healthier than I am logging its macros
Possibly? I think like an unofficial one
At least for another 7 minutes till the game starts 
Stay strong Nick!
App idea #10: Phone that locks you out of all things except calls to make you focus and not check your phone too much and it does like 50 minutes locked, 10 minutes unlocked 
Dang Niel! 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 😚
You aren't even good
YAS
Like it would be sweet if I could put a white self changing writing on my current screen saver....
Logan app idea: I like to have a "to do list" as my lock screen wallpaper however I hate making a new one in my ugly looking notepad, screenshot the updated one, then reset it as my lock screen so if an app looked clean and did all that and updated your lock screen at the same time as updating the list.... I want part of the money you make from this golden idea
YES
In the moment you will regret that but long term you won't 👍🏽
Hmm.. Why not haha
Is she hot?
Hahaha You have two trades to correct 34 points to 79
And I'm sorry I didn't get to weigh in on picking on Niel.. 
But bring it on this week boi
Niel you're so white
Florida! No tv!
No freakin way I am literally dying not watching
WHAT HAPPENED I NEED DETAILS
What's my name for it?
Nick I love how you still used a comma regardless of how angry you were lol
Ha
Sorry I have this group on silence since it can go off repeatedly at some bad times (the one exam I forgot to turn my phone off don't worry it was vibrate at least) but I can't tonight! Probably not till Wednesday
I didn't think so lol
Logan you play?
Same
He's like 2 years old
I be in Florida for spring break
Shoot... Only chance you have is on the computer like Zach
Oh... PS3 right?
But the real question is do you have a PS4?
When's the last time we've seen you?
Just wait till we have tourney's at Logan's on weekends over summer
DID YOU GET ROCKET LEAGUE YET
No no like the fantasy one
Nick change the name of our group!!
And why does it look like a rec league jersey..... Like the kind where it's 2 dollars more to get two different colors on your shoulders for the generic jersey that anyone could make and basically all teams would use
I still have to do it and that Jersey/crest combo is horrid 
NICE!!!! About time the crew becomes more visible and not using sketchy sites just to watch them in 120p 
What's the Crew and CW thing?
😂
No clue she just saw a picture of Parkhurst and said she likes him... It's a start I will take it lol
Emily's new favorite player is Michael Parkhurst
Oh wow
If you as my it was a pretty perfect pic on my part 😎
No no like I 100% back my opinion regardless of who I am a fan of! As long as Barca defense keeps holding up they really won't be beat especially in a two game series
And Barca is going to win it all I already know it... MSN is unstoppable
What you guys talkin bout??
Nah I feel everyone else we bring in drops out too quick...
Emily doesn't know anything about soccer and played when she was 7 😂
She say she cute&fabulous22@aol.com
Brianhoffman2012@gmail.com or you can reach me at soccerprincess12@aol.com
Because Elizabeth Hurley..
Wait is that Bedazzled!?!?!?!?
Haha Yeah I realize it was the 17th but still!! And nope I don't have the money to spend on video games when Curtis already has a PS4
ROCKET LEAGUE FOR XBOX ONE TODAY
He called the cops 😂😂😂
Oh Logan by the way.. Today I had to work and I was just doing a transfer (talking on the phone to some pharmacist at Kroger receiving a prescription for a patient to fill at my store) and I was simply going through all the things I needed for them and then I said "What was the original date of the prescription?" And she goes "6/12" and I go "Oh that's Logan's birthday".... So we both paused.. 10 seconds go by and I just go "bye" and hang up 😂😂😂😂😂 Most awkward thing ever I panicked and didn't know what to even say and even forgot to ask when they last filled it
And she's very pretty Craigy... If only you knew how to park
"Dated"
Daddy
DM me them
I'm interested Nick
Consider every message from Nick "liked" by me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I like the family is everything statement because technically I consider you guys family as wel and look how much it sucks to hear people all living in different areas and then look how weird it would be not seeing like Paul and David for months at a time... But also I like traveling and new experiences and want to be open to change
I feel everyone is kinda set on their own opinions already haha 
#FingersInTheBootyAssBitch ☝
Your move Nick
no thanks
What is it?

HOW ADORABLE IS MY PROFESSOR!?
To clarify that is "suck" not something else..
Going to sleep tho.. Nick you da mayne! Welcome to the 21+ club everyone else can $uck it
I will send a pic next time I do it... It will be glorious
HAPPY BIRTHDAY NICK!!!!!!!!
RIP in peace, mustache
Had a hella good mustache going over the weekend where I shaved everything else bare but now it's time for school tomorrow and I had to let him go.. 😞😞
Wow Nick I didn't know you knew so much about fashion
Dang Nielson... Looking good 😏
yep
https://media3.giphy.com/media/3o85xsOgW1aDjUQLkI/giphy.gif
Pochettino my hero
LLORIS LITERALLY JUST GOT LIKE A CONCUSSION TO WIN THAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yep! Long time!
She was one of Tatum's good friends
She do
Proba Ashtyn
WOOOO
I'm happy you guys like him :) Respectable young lad he is
What a cutie
LETS GO TOTTENHAM
Wow
Look at Bolt Speedman fly past everyone and score back post!
Is that yo!?
I saw he got subbed in and was shocked I had no clue he transferred
McCoy leads with 10 points lol
This fantasy week has been very dry throughout the first half
You look like a lumberjack
Gotcha! I don't listen to either anymore they both trash!
Yeezy is Kanye? Or Wayne?
I've watched it 5 times
https://www.facebook.com/LiamDineen/videos/577213465796036/
Please tell me you guys are able to watch that lol
I only do anal
Nice ;)
My MedChem teacher said it's spreading by the thousands in Brazil... Luckily we are in the winter while it's the outbreak so mosquitos are a huge deal
Yeah it's all fine very light symptoms (possible rare severe neurological symptoms) but mostly just microcephaly in newborn babies if a girl gets it while prego! So just try not to knock up Julie or Lexi till they figure this thing out and we good!
It's in Cleveland so Logan don't die over the summer
Two words: Zika Virus
You posted the logo and said "I'm so excited for this season" and I was worried we were switching to that!
Nick what the heck is that?
Ascaris lumbricoides ☺️
Dang I wish we all could go get one together 
Anything
Yep! No spaces
Emily
Wait for it... Maybe use a capital R she left that part out
And tell Julie too
Text "raincheck" to 888-222 for a free chipotle burrito 
I just cracked the 1400s! So proud :)
Wowowowowow
That goal... Wow
I'd kiss Isaac
AYYYYY!!!! This Trippier guy has been crucial today! He's good af on the wing
He just got subbed on! It's game time now!
Hey Niel.. Thomas is still beating you over all and he hasn't played for 5 weeks 😮
They don't play each other for a while so we will never know
Not today though! I think Tottenham could do it
You're wrong Logan
Tottenham has 12 goal attempts to Watfords 1 in the first half
Also who do you think would win between Leicester and Tottenham rn
How has Tottenham not scored yet... I'm getting annoyed 
He's not wrong 
Wow.. My idol
Did they play the song!?
Like x5000^^^^
Winner keeps Lexi... Let's raise the stakes
Nice lawyer persuasion skills though... That earned you like +2 persuasion levels if this were Skyrim
I would've made him a cup of tea.. Talk about love and what life could really be me
Julie told me this morning actually.. I didn't know what to say so I was going to wait till you guys were ready... I'll miss the little weirdo.. The strangest most lovable dog ever
When it looks to your standard
Craig I say you've come this far just hold off from putting it into a bun until it's ready
😂
I will call it for the night the Internet is all messed up lol
Hahaha Nick GPA doesn't make you a good pharmacist! 
I've often thought about the possibility of opening a pharmacy with David after I had years of work and making my own money... Nick join in
True that to Nick! They're expanding a lot of what we do!! I swear every year I hear of one more thing we can "prescribe" because they realize we know twice as much as any doctor when it comes to meds AND are taught diagnosis and disease states in school
Because we've got doctorate degrees ;)
What game is that?
You the boy Craig!
I have to trade out an 8.8 De Bryune with 1.0 free already AND all the top midfielders are playing like crap except Mahrez who has a tough streak of games coming up... What is life
Screw De Bryune
You guys all just say the sweetest things :)
😢🔫
Don't I have 5 midfielders too? So no subs lol
He's out??
Oh god who did I pick?
What's that
I say yes to greatest all time and yeah Nick I started watching towards the end of Jimmy's time but they have a good outlook at things! I don't watch them all though
I think it would be cool to see Messi in the Prem but he doesn't have to prove himself in my eyes.. That replacement for Jimmy Conrad made it really clear in one of his videos
Yeah or my boy
NEW YEAR NEW TEAM
Zardes looks dead
And I just like Finlay's work ethic and 110% all the time
USA passing in general looks really good
AYYYYY
I hope berhalter is watching
;)
Aight
Do we like Acosta??
I want to make my 3-1 score prediction more specific.... Kristinn scores their goal
They are really praising altidore
Hahaha Oh wow I really need to up my testosterone levels
Hahahaha No I swear!!! 
Hahahaha Literally for 10 minutes only it was that or bowling!!
Watching keeping up with the kardashians until 4 as has been great
I don't know him or Acosta
Thanks bruh
Shoot I don't have one! Can you post a pic?
Where you seeing the lineup?
Head to head for sure! Free for all is what premier league is for
So.. MLS fantasy or na? 
That would be awesome.. Finally bringing defenders over! And 3-1 USA
Literally listening to that album now hahaha
Gotta get my Gyasi jersey on mane!!!
What time/channel?
☺️
😢
You've grown up so fast 😢😩
Happy Birthday McCoy! 
Me
ya
I'm obsessed with JB and 1D albums on repeat back and forth
Hahaha Ties into our point made a long time ago that Brazilians peak early lol
You sure you're looking at the right guy?
Wait...
37
That's why I think it's an awesome idea! Whether instead of Myrtle or additional to Myrtle
True about hiking being extremely cheap!
Hiking and camping even for an extended weekend when I'm actually home could be fun........ 
Anyone actually hear anything about Falcao lately??
There better be some sweet chili Doritos 
When and where?
😉
Like the FIFA tournament this year?
Hahaha The day you two get married I am going to sit him down at a table and tell him what I really have thought of him all these years.. He will have no choice but to adopt me and be my best friend
My boi Rob and I reminiscing 
Joined the crew with Kathmandu
And dang I thought I had a good app idea!!
She claims that she didn't cry when I texted her telling her you wanted to kiss her and then it all was a lie... BS
Hey app idea....
What if when someone leaves a voicemail the same operator system that converts words to text when you're driving converts their words to text from a voicemail but obviously able to listen as well
BAM
Nick, you and I are mentioned and your part with he words "pointlessly lies" literally made me laugh for 3 minutes
Nice Avi
I read it right when it was posted haha
Just went 7-0 by myself in online 3 player rocket league 😎
Soccer? Mine is channel 20 on regular buckeye cable or whatever
How do we know you're not isis, Nick?
Nah
Wouldn't mind an Arsenal goal
Maybe Chelsea is a part of isis... Costa definitely seems dirty enough
Suck it
I wonder if anyone has Mertesacker on their team
Not watching the game 😞
Hahaha Thank you McCoy.. 
Stupid Arnautovic not playing
I watched second half.. Logan...... If your captain pick was Firmino then you would easily take a comfortable lead in fantasy
CRAIG OMG CECH IS A MONSTER!
The second he scored I said "Dangit Logan"
ROONEY!!!
I would rather lick his deltoid than her nip.. Just sayin
His shoulder is bigger than her boob.. 
So much so I liked my own comment
10/10 would bang..
DID SOMEONE SAY DISCOUNT!?
Anyone have Ward-prouse?
SAME
I refuse to pick up Wijnaldum because I think he is only going to play well for a little longer but so tempting
And there's no way he is already silver!!
Wait you have it!?
Just reached Silver 1 for the first time
Nice!!!
McCoy and Logan did you guys yard expand??
I had a notification!!! Good stuff!
Hey I have this chat muted just because in-class purposes but someone try to @ me so I can see if it goes past the mute in case you have to get a hold of me
1%
Up to you guys! And I have been getting on Tumblr more ever since its been on my phone ☺️
I'm afraid to check the scores on ESPN
Who's that?
I would be up for a sick computer when I'm older and out of college! For now I stick with my 360 and that's it
PS4 is a waste of money in my opinion I only agree with a new gaming system in Logan and McCoy's case where they traded in about $300 worth or more of stuff
Then use his??? Rocket League is only $20
Does Donnie have one? And sorry I don't have time lol
So Messi with a 5th ballon D'or by a long shot
Plus they might eventually figure out the link between PC and PS4 in rocket league!
Tempting honestly but since I'm not buying any new counsel or game I wouldn't
Ready for some rocket league!?
Jealous... How's the PS4 process?
Maybe college just sucks
Oh that happened to me over a year ago when I never received mine
Hahaha Nice Nick
And Logan you would just have to get it from her but that's the easiest and I don't trust shipping
Logan how do you want FIFA 16?? Shipped or give it to Sarah wood who is coming to Toledo for this upcoming weekend and then leaving to go back home (taking a semester off and no she's not coming to see me)
Well did they at least make some money off of Jmac?
First class syllabus lasted 5 minutes exact
Expansion!!!
Watching Harold and Kumar on tv and guess what word I see
Can you blame him?? She's worth some jail time
She hot?
Thanks boo
Nick on my way to your house
Okie!
Nick do you know when you will get to Meier with the box??
Welp I will find a place to get that box from ya
Please do! But I was hoping but I have to do school stuff this weekend 😩
Wait you weren't talking about hanging today?
Oh... I would drive to your house possibly
This evening
Haha I don't need that 😂
YES!!! Please bring it!
Weird question but I am really hoping
Nick do you have a FIFA 15 box at your house that I can have and I will get you mine from school?
He is going out to get something but will be back within an hour or two
I'm already at LoPa!
Today 😩
Yeah boi!
You have some good lighting.. As in Christmas lights
10/10. Would bang.
Haha That last place person!
Yessir!
Logan/Zach I'm leavin now
Blue USMNT Zardes jersey long sleeve from Nick
I bet you get your sterling before I get mine! 😂😂
It's very high quality!!
Aight
Sooner the better
Yessir
@Zach Spangler is Rocket League happening tomorrow?
Oh wow.. Congrats 
What's that?
Please bring it!! I've been looking at paddles all yesterday and I feel I've found one but I want to see how his plays before I commit
Yeah! That could be fun! Do you have Craig's old AliExpress paddle??
I might chill at Logan's and play ultimate team or have them here and play ping pong and like always everyone is invited haha
Just curious.. Are we ever getting those nudes or no?
I'm good with both!
Who feels like we should do one massive 500 point game heroclix on a small map?
Niel when is next year's person getting their jersey??
Niel when am I getting my jersey??
It usually just allows you at some random time this week
Tuesday I have to do school stuff
I vote Wednesday 
So who we got for Tuesday Star Wars???
Hmm.. Is Chelsea bouncing back??
Ye
I now follow Nathalie on tumblr
Are you doing the FIFA tournement!?
Poor Nick
Bring Nick's
Another year without my jersey
I would say come around 10
Nick I'm excited for your arrival in the morning ☺️
That's for children
Yessir!
I will probably set my alarm for whenever 7.5 hours of sleep is
Whenever
@Craig Casto 
@Craig Casto 
That's fair^^
Ping pong and iron site too
The biggest tourney of the year
Why though.. You said Saturday 
HE MUST COME
HE LIVES
Oh man! Coffee, heroclix or even morning hot tub!
Plus the draft will take an hour at least I'm sure of that
Heroclix ping pong and iron site
We can always Heroclix before everyone comes
If so the earlier we start the better
Well Ninny and Pop are going to be there tomorrow night right?
12AM
Nick you a for sure not coming tonight?
Sounds perfect! We are writing teams down and then all share at the same time and if there are any duplicates you play a game to decide the person who gets it
Why not?
Yee
Get off summer school end of June
I just asked someone the approximated date since he's a year older
And Craig you're coming no dumb excuses you're part of the group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEpDTJF-JzE
Nick's bread and butter
Night of January 1st is the FIFA tourney
😂
You know.. This might be my favorite Tumblr post of all time
Yeah we do and everyone said it messes it up
That's why I haven't got it
Does it mess everything up?
Wasn't sure if it was worth it or not lol
Logan, did you download El Capitan?
33 almonds = 0.1 lb
Which mall?
I've had a loootttt of downtime lol I can watch the 5th if you guys are going 4-6 then 1-3
I've watched the 1st through the 4th Star Wars already 😂
During or after what?
Well we should hang
What's everyone up to today?
😢
McCoy, got your jersey yet?
s'sorry I can't 
THATS FREAKIN AWESOME
Something like this?
That's a fair question.. 
Merry Christmas fam 🎄🎄
Oh just some model chick
Craig AE has your perfect girl
I work 9-5pm on the 2nd 
They are going to try and win a title with DP players only
Traded Marcelo -> Sucked
Trading Omar and Juninho -> F me
Send me
I want to sleep for 24 hours
Wait McCoy did you get your jersey?
I will when I see yo next I don't have that app
Brianhoffman2012@gmail.con

I will send it to David
Got the gloves on our way
Meet us at the turf
Don't forget cleats! We are thinking of kicking it around now also bring a ball if you want a specific one for golf
Heck yeah!
I'm ready whenever
When would you come Nick?
What if we got the tournament draft started??
Wait Logan did you get a Lukaku last year?
Hahaha It would be the same story as Raheem leaving
Goodbye Omar 😢
I just passed them!!!
I might come over a bit later then!
What are you guys doing tonight?
Dang
Anyone want to shoot around on Logan's net?
I'm up to hang both nights though
Why give presents if you're ending it?
Tbh.. I think Philippines deserved it... Did you see the rack on that girl!?
HAA JK THEY READ IT WRONG AND TOOK THE CROWN BACK FROM COLOMBIA AS SHE ALREADY CELEBRATED IT AND GAVE IT TO THE GORGEOUS FILIPINO!
Colombia wins miss universe!
You alright?
Logan's homemade recipe
Haha You never should've told us that..
Congrats mane!
:)
Wait what!?!? YESSSS
Everton is in form and is good and there was just something about Martinez talking about his defense 
SCREW U MCCOY!!! MAHREZ WAS MY AUDACIOUS CAPTAIN PICK!
What about the 24th?
With what?
If that worked then I would rather not do the morning to have everyone here
Also I want to work something out I'm just saying we aren't good at planning and commiting so that's the most fair way if we don't get this figured out
Only thing I can think of is do both events back to back on the 23rd after 3pm and just not do the Classic in the morning
Hey guys I think if we don't figure all this out then we should hold off on the FIFA tourney and just have the Christmas Eve Classic at 9am on Christmas Eve like always until we get people to commit to other options
Sooo have we figured the 23rd out yet?
Literally any time that day! That's why we thought to knock both out in the same day so we make sure everyone is there
What about at night though?
7 person round robin on the 23rd! Soccer golf in the morning and tourney at night! Please everyone drop plans and come!
And AM is soccer golf and PM is tourney
And Nick right?? Nick you good!?
Wait Craig are there goals up??
No I meant that's how long it takes you to do those two things lol I am just going to get my stuff on and come over
So 2 hours 😂
I haven't done "activity" in 2 weeks
When should we go?
YAS
TAS
Whenever we hear from Logan
ha
Wait would they have nets up for us??
Shoot!! 
Logan?
Nick will drive home rn and meet us
Yeah!
We got one!
😳
Soccer at the turf could've been sweet!
😞
Who wants to do something today!?
Haha Not your fault just checking! 
Who doesn't have their jersey and when are we all hanging out?
Logan I don't think you heard me earlier but I shared with the group how good Jake Miller is and I figured you would have agreed
Hey
We might be in that now
We on back roads some how
Haha We literally passed the campus 😂😂 I'm so lost!
Just got off at the ONU exit nick 
So we are currently on our way home and David is driving and I forgot to tell him our exit so we are literally almost at ONU but I haven't told him I completely messed it up
My house! And I have the belt packed!! On my way!
The similarity factor is a logarithmic reciprocal square root transformation of the sum of squared error and is a measurement of the similarity in the percent (%) of dissolution between the two curves
I totally forgot how good Jake Miller is
Did they already give you a scholarship??
Niel I'm so sorry your 4.0 was just overshadowed by McCoy lol You're still smart to lol
SO PROUD!!
2
Those are the days I can't but they aren't even next to Christmas Eve so that shouldn't be a problem
I am in Cleveland the 19-22
Niel awesome work
I am okay with moving the SOCCER Classic if needed but everyone better have their Santa hat and be ready for hot tub after
And we have had no movement on our drafting FIFA tourney however it needs to be played
NICE
Why is Kristinn still my Avi?
Craig I'm taking that back to where it belongs!! Be ready to hand it back to the true owner
No surprise you liked your photo
ESPN scores are all out of whack right now
MINE CAME IN TODAY MY DAD SENT ME PICS AND ITS MUY BUENO!
Craig... 2 in a row.... I will let Logan or McCoy the true "Colombians" have your head for this one
Craig I thought your GroupMe account was hacked and then I noticed the misspelled word
I always enjoy Zach's words of wisdom
Having a girlfriend be like
https://media2.giphy.com/media/a2f8mOunuMjjq/giphy.gif
Hahaha Nick and Barry at the same time.. Fight to the death
Call me Lance Armstrong
Am I a bachelor?
She's typically a good sport
I would just punch her in the teeth and she would understand
🔥🔥🔥
Me too
Whatever he's got against anyone I still agree with what Nielson says
I also think that is crossing the line I almost would rather have them text flirty than hang out and do stuff together.. I believe before break is the best time to end things if you were going to because then you have a month home with your family and friends to take your mind off everything
Yee
Why you a push over?
Thata boy Craig :) Accompanied by some ladies I assume
Should be studying for finals but I'm on Tumblr
Haven't gotten mine either
1. I agree with Logan and Niel
2. She chose to do long distance and take the risk whether it was her chance to attempt to move on or just start fresh but it is clear now she hasn't done either
3. Niel I'm coming to you more if I have girl problems 😂
Not her
Whoever said that it should be you doing the thinking of break up I agree
I wouldn't let her take advantage of you either.. If she still loves her ex then there is nothing she can say that should justify her hanging out with him (and hiding him) and my opinion is take control of the situation 
I don't think I could say it any better than that... I agree with everything Niel says
That is messed up.. If by now she still can't get over her ex then that's a problem especially if she tries to hide stuff from you
What's there to explain? I thought we all shared in this friend group! Just like Julie and Zach!
I would dunk on Lexi EVERY time she walked by that
I was wondering the same thing...
Like a 5 year deal
I remember you saying that lol
That's pretty sexy
I get two this year 😎
IM SUCH A LOSER I HAVE SPENT ALL MORNING CLASHING WITH THE MASSIVE NEW UPDATE 😂😂😂😂
Way way better
Wow I don't even know you guys...
Might be the worst song ever
Goodluck! I kept telling all my P1s that the best way they can prepare for the finals is to have a good grade going into them lol
It will happen! And does anyone else do numbers over and over to determine what they need on the final for whatever grade they want?
I still want to do that online coding over break!!
I mean it comes down to "recognition" rather than memorizing because I had an exam Monday and Tuesday which both needed way more than memorization/recognition to prepare for
Meds and Terms.. Just like a pure memorization exam
People were so exhausted from studying they chugged monsters before haha
That exam blew!!!!! 
That moment before an exam you realize how little you actually know..
:/ Did you just take it?
Who has heard of Kalin and Myles?? If you have listen to I See You it's pretty good
Me between all these finals
https://media0.giphy.com/media/kFcqmxrh5txwQ/giphy.gif
3. I tell people to stop texting and driving but I do it myself
1. Yes
2. Quick text or read an email
3. Usually at stop lights I do it but definitely naive to the dangers haha
Might not be able to come home until the 18th though
17th
Probs start Kristinn on the left instead of Meram
I like McCoy's way of thinking today!
Who agrees with that?
We just need to play Kristenn more ☺️
But who do I want to replace is the question........ I love our outside backs, parkhurst has been better, Sauro I like, Trapp obvi and Tchani is kinda a gay sometimes but good and so on
Also that video I posted about those bad jokes he defended the MLS by saying we are 20 years old and other leagues are close to 100 and their leagues were in complete shambles back when they were this young so I think taking that into account we have to realize we are just growing! 
If we put an average of 100 more fans in seats for this upcoming season then this is all a success for me!!
THATS THE ATTITUDE!!!!
�
Higuain wasn't as good as I would've liked either.. And why has Finlay reverted back to just trying to sprint as fast as possible and losing it
Tha sucked... To lose a game which was 50/50 the whole time off the worst mistakes and missed call
The order you guys were standing in because I saw you on tv!!!!!!
McCoy - Danniele - Craig - Julie - Logan
Hahaha Nick your girl's pic on Facebook 😂
7 hours 😳
😳😳😳
And the putting an end to some annoying jokes
Hahaha I love the MLS support 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFMIMxJWTGw
That would be fun
Ohhh yeah definitely!!! 
Well soccer as well but Christmas Eve classic I don't want any randoms
That Gif 😂😂
Aight so I'm not the only one lol
Niel are you going?
ITS GONNA BE A GOOD CHRISTMAS!!
Haha That would be crazy..... We would literally have to pay for him and pay for a bigger stadium just to fit all the new fans
I am really excited to see who the crew sign next!!! Especially if we win!
OFF THE POST!
WHAT!!!
He's too fast for his own good
Hahaha I was waiting for someone to say that
Ices the cake
I still say 50/50 game since it's just a game of who can score on the counter... I'm waiting for that one Crew goal that basically seals in
I'm afraid of NYRB scoring one and getting hot hand and wreck us
I think this will be a high scoring game.. Maybe my 1-1 prediction wasn't enough
I say 1-1
Got it
How do I stream???
Breaking News: C Supreme has officially passed Niel.Skalican
So maybe end of June?
For pharmacy we all have 6 weeks of school this summer so that our program isn't a 7 year program
I can't I have school
Woah
Woah..
BARKLEY!!!!!!!!!
It's sooooo hard to dribble.. I must need to play it a lot 
Do you guys like 16 more than 15?? I just played it and it's so jerky and the dribbling is awful
My dad just died laughing at this 😂
Home screen -> go to groupme -> then it should be right there in the app
I can take him...
By that I mean where there are many many games!
I think we all should get a crazy ping pong tournament and add that to our traditions... Who agrees??
Ordered my jersey ✅
Not me
Should we do it on FIFA 15 or 16?
There we go! I was waiting haha 
Hahaha Suck it Craig! And guys how about we draft for the FIFA tournement the first time we hang out for Christmas break and then have the tournament the second time we hang out
Did McCoy get new paint on his car?
Haha If we are allowed to use it...
YESSSSSS
Dang..
We could hot tub..
Nick?
Is everyone home??
FINALLY HOME
I KNOW!!! WHAT A BOSS!!

Kei Kamara sports science
What's the date??
WAS THAT A MEG BY HIGUAIN!?!?!?
 Wowowowow
Jealous
And Leicester being in the #1 spot
Anyone watching Tottenham kicking some butt?
Hmm maybe me and Curt can get you on our team!
6 of us
I wish all 5 of us could play somehow
Hmm.. I might do that if I play alone
Haven't ever done training but from everything I've seen its the best thing ever
Hahaha I don't even know if we have good connection or not.. I'm currently working on incorporating flying into my games
Wait what the heck? Lol Yours has to be different than PS4 😂
Hahaha I used Curtis' second account for a while so I just started my own named after my favorite soccer ball Baden and I am level 15
I just played 1 V 1 and they like quit mid way through so I took some time to pad my stats
McCoy.... My good man... I believe our aggregate was about 9 - 2 
Get on my level boyz
Haha What?
I'm 100% serious too lol
Haha Yeah I play all the time!!
ZACH I PLAY ROCKET LEAGUE ALMOST ON THE DAILY WITH CURTIS ON HIS PS4!!
Nice!!! 
It's almost been like 8 years or something
Wait McCoy how did you explain us!?
Actually Tuesday night!
And next Wednesday!
Why?
I'm down
Ohh I get it
What do you mean?
Woah that's sweet
Surprised no one has brought up Paris 
If I can do it then anyone can do it
It's quite simple though!
As of now I agree... Like Neymar is not better "now" than both the way Ronaldo and Messi were
No matter what as long as Neymar doesn't get hurt he will skyrocket 
So I will like my own
Nick I want to like your comment again 😂
As for my Avi..... Deal with it
Ronaldinho -> Messi -> Neymar
I watch his highlights too and it no longer is pure flair it's just the complete package now
Messi is hurt, Ronaldo is in a slump and if you take all of his data and line them up looking at the big picture he has declined (makes me want to cry but still) and Neymar has completely over taken everything with the help of Suarez
I love you.
The Founder of No Shave November
No I don't think so
Lovin this day off...
I hate ESPN lol
Still would've traded you to be at that game
Either way though I had on the lucky socks!
I have an exam tomorrow 😩
IM SO JEALOUS!!!!
BEST GAME IVE EVER WATCHED
YYYYYEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH
DYDHEYEYYEYEESSSSSHSJSJFJF
Side
Off
Lucky socks.. We basically already won
GOALLLL
Curtis went to click on you and said you weren't there lol
It says you aren't in it there's only 9 people
Nick why you out of the fantasy??
I assume that's a no
http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7503068
I believe that the "revenues" from the athletics include all the ticket sales, tv earnings, and everything 
INSANELY stupid... There we go if we got a president to take action on something like that then that will solve the whole supplying money for college students issue
RIGHT!!! You could be going through college with a substantial decrease in money out of your pocket if it weren't for that
Niel that college sports video you liked on Facebook is soooo true
✅
Put a ✅ if you've already sent in your jersey specs
YAS
UNNECESSARY RABONA!!!
Yep! Haha
I know we are lucky
We also can make floating gaf heads
Any more question Craig?
Screw Drogba.. I hope he dies for 80 minutes and then they resuscitate him but has complications and dies again for 90 minutes the next time we play them
10
And I sat Lukaku
When the person you start is the only attacker without involvement in a goal
😡
2-2
I didn't even catch that!
😂
Time to play a be a pro match!
Nope.. Tipped off of Stones
Just traded him Friday 😑
GOAL
Even someone like that would make a difference
Moyes
Hahaha They would poison his legacy!
I agree McCoy that's what I thought!! Like they are still just as good mentally in their later ages and if we can snatch them up because they wanted a change of pace that would grow our league like crazy!
Alright guys here's a question for you all!! We talk about MLS getting all these great players such as Drogba who come in and make an impact but what would you guys think the outcome would be if we instead got someone like Pep or Mourinho here?
OMFG HOWARD IS A FREAKEN BOSS!!!
*Goes to YouTube, types in Birdy, listens to two songs, turns it off, decides that's not for me*
I've had twenty one pilots going on my laptop for literally 6 hours now
I know ☹
I started only 3 defenders.... People better start scoring
"Next season"... I think every day he is getting older and one injury or knock can be the end of him and all his form
I still can't admit to myself he is a sure thing for next season
Like no big name player wants to go to Australian league to retire instead Beckham chose to come here and opened the possibility that we are a good and equal league and now players see us as a growing league and want to join.. So if those three big name players are here and they suck then whatever that's their respective teams deciding to waste one of their starting 11 but keep them here and help the league grow
I agree but for now we are in transition state so to get linked to more good players as time goes on we have to have a league with some good players already.. Don't know if that makes sense
I CALLED IT!! HE SUCKED
Logan won fantasy, Galaxy already out of tourney, and I am crying on the inside
I will fill you in
I didn't even see jy
I think Gerrard is a waste of money
😂😂😂😂
Earlier the better
Yeah because I would say about at least 4 other people tried talking to him
I got his business card as well but he told me he graduated from ONU so he would be happy to have you! 
He said he will take any students for shadowing.... I would do this he seems knowledgeable and easy to talk to
It's up to you! Let me know your email if you want but I could always try to get his
For real???
"A lot of pharmacists don't want to go into oncology pharmacy so I'm hoping to change your mind" 
That sounds good for you!
But I'm not leaning towards that as of now
Haha Perks is we are different years so never have to worry about competition!
That way I could actually learn instead of him fly through it 
I think so! I wish he gave us the PowerPoint so I can take notes but whatev
😂😂 Touché
Nick I'm currently listening to an oncology pharmacist giving a presentation during my lunch
MY SHINY TEETH THE SPARKLE!! JUST LIKE THE STARS IN SPACE!!
Hahaha I wish we started it all sooner
But Nick I would save that in your notes and you can be our secretary haha
McCoy you sortve got shafted with MIT since you two were equal before it lol
Hahaha Nah he deserved it for sure..
Anything t possibly increase competition throughout any season makes me happy because people quit literally within weeks
I vote for the MLS Supporters Shield to be a thing...
My two defenders didn't play so there was no chance
I think regardless of Adi scoring I lost it
😩😩😩
If I captained Nagbe it would've been so much better
Giovinco needs a brace to get me back in this
Finley killing it.... Congratulations Logan on your first fantasy trophy lol
Gargan and Feilhaber aren't playing either!!! 😩😩😩😩
Hahaha Jeez Nick..
Remick isn't playing so hopefully Polster or Burling get subbed in or something
Hahaha If only he was good
Too bad Nagbe will be scoring the goals today
Nice Adi trade
Logan what goalie do you have playing?
Logan all trades better be in that excel sheet!
😂😂😂😂 He has a point craig
😂😂☺️
Jersey exchange, somehow start some FIFA draft picking (we can do the tourney over Christmas break), and make sure everyone has their Santa hats if they are feeling the SOCCER Classic which undisputedly will be held Christmas Eve 
Craig is current champ of the SOCCER Classic! 
Hahaha This whole time I knew Niel was just waiting to pick a fight and now it's all gone 😂
🔥
Wait... Did Niel just call out Nick in fantasy?
You're missing out.. 
And Tottenham 5-1
He's good!
Yeah they are really fighting for their life right now
I thought it was something minor a long time ago
For how long?
Another question.. Where the heck is David Silva?
Haha It's funny because it's even on the excel that we both have him
I made two transfers and made sure not to use anyone else's players
You're fine you don't have to worry about it lol
My team is 100% updated on the excel
You have one of my players Logan... Polster
Hahahaha
Liked my own post 😎
Lamela scored
3 - 1
Lol not @ Tottenham you jerk
If Kolarov scores and keeps a clean sheet then that's my only way at a decent week
I wish..
Craig you are such a lovable guy.. I want you to take my wedding pics 
We should start a larp team
No it wasn't!!! There was no harm in that message!!
Haha I actually meant to know if he was serious!! I like a competitive league unlike last year! Everyone drops off at different times
Are you being sarcastic or serious? Legit question
Not proud... Mls is all I've got right niw
Don't remind me
Keeping the fantasy titles with Nick and me
DOWN WITH THE PATIÑOS
I'm trying!
Yeah that's what the bottom part is
Andre taking last
Nick you got the Supporter's Shield
McCoy do you have any other players this week? I don't think you have any SKC or COL..
Tell me about it...
McCoy this Galaxy game rn is going to basically decide which one of us moves on
Truu
So the only person I know that has been rightfully assigned is Niel
You guys need to become true fans of the show
I'm all caught up except 1 episode
Get ready for some Vinegar strokes my friend
😏
I'll be Sophia if Logan is Ruxin
😂
I love how I'm still capitalized :)
Logan..
I thought McCoy was Taco and Logan was Kevin since Julie is a subpar version of Jenny
Therefore Niel is going to secretly steal my girl.....
Wait... Who's Pete?
I need Galaxy to wreck Portland up the anus
Yeah!! Hahaha
I could've got rid of had 8 trades by this time!
Yeah 😩
And I forgot our MLS goes into Semi finals and all that so I've given up the past 4 weeks instead of prepare my team and now I might lose to McCoy..... 😑
Hahahaha Step it up Nielson!
Who likes my Avi?
Noice!
Lazy sundays
Zach has the heart and the gumption
Hahaha I think we are all in agreement!
Currently talking with Curtis about how socialism wouldn't work and all that crap and I brought up a good point to him: Why don't we let Zach run our country?
Neymar: 4 goals + 1 assist
4:20
Sorry the first pic goes last
Alright everyone... I redid it and actually voted and read about each issue and how much I care and here it is... I am basically nobody
What did you guys say about the union thing?
Hahaha Who are these people?
Ohhhh I gotcha!
When they said tax the rich for less student loan interest what do they consider the "rich"
I have tears coming out of my face
😂😂😂😂 I'm literally dying laughing
Wow Zach you are truly awful hahahaha
😂😂😂😂 That message is so wrong I had to like it 
Curtis proposed an idea of the purge 👍🏽
😂😂😂😂😂
Because that is bias for sure I'm not that awful of a person hahaha
Yeah that's why I would never say anyone in specific lol
I would never say for a single person to not reproduce I'm saying that uneducated/intelligent group as a whole
I am black and white with it and I don't mean to be so strict but I'm saying overall concept hahaha
But I mean in all seriousness it's kinda true!!! McCoy you're a man of knowledge aren't you!?
Hahha I am just tough enough to say it!
What!?!?
But wouldn't you guys say that the trash of America not technically just "go die" but not reproduce and pass their genes on?
Guys I will do mine again later and take it serious haha
He said since I still believe in survival of the fittest I'm a conservative
Guys supposedly I'm a conservative according to Curtis
I feel like I should've said if I care more or less about things and done the extra questions instead of somewhat for everything hahaha
Y'all are tender
Hilary is going to win... 
What can I say fellas.. I'm known for my tough ess
5-7min
Analyze me!! I guess I'm a Hilary Clinton kind of gal 💁🏽
Hahaha Cincinnati Binturongs 
Soooo Toledo is better than Cinci.. Let's redo the conversation from last year at this point in time while I'm considered the number 2 college in this chat
I think I can help with the Pam pamb delimna.. The answer is Wil Trapp
If I were Klinsmann I would go H.A.M. on getting these young players to the best they can be because they are our best hope! 
Yeah!! I have high hopes for him as well as the Internet does haha
No like Alevero?
What's that young center backs name?
And Yedlin of course
Just wait for Gyasi Trapp and that young center back to start taking over
However losing big games is not okay I do agree there but friendlies are experiment times in my eyes
The man has to deal with mediocre players and new talents and somehow try to please us each and every game
Hey now! He's our national team coach respect him!
Well would you guys say Klinsman is quite a direct guy and doesn't care as much for the Spain-like possession? Because with our low quality of pace and skill we can't play quick counter attacks like that like Brazil could or teams like Real Madrid
From everything I saw online it's always because our awful play out of the back and lack of possession because of these awful plays
I saw those yesterday
Hi Niel
🙍🏽
Btw Logan my Be a Pro is now up to an 87 overall.. Workin it hard
Hi Zach
Haha Nick I like the Avi
I'm saying that our old experienced players are going downhill just in general and our new players are taking over like Zardes and soon to be Trapp and I think the transition is killing us.. Our line up seems to be quite different from the World Cup line up and we have three years to experiment and make that again
Btw I think whatever happens today happens and Klinnsman can't always be at fault for such a young team.. To bring someone new in would cause so many problems so unless he starts ruining our chances at qualifying for the World Cup my opinion is always leave him there and let our players get experience
Oh shoot I should be good then
For when it comes on just in case
:)
The game
Can anyone help out?
I'm totally blanking on streaming sites...
That's sexy...
Should I actually get this app?
Is it on cable tv?
I vote Howard but I'm fine with Guzan he does a good job
It's homecomin week so we better
Kent State
Toledo plays at 3 to keep the unbeaten streak!
