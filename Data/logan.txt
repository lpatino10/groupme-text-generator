Also I hate you
That's quite the tip 👀👀
Yeah it's easy probably if you have all of that knowledge but not from the ground floor lol. It's all good though that's a popular technology and it'll be good to learn!
So it's gonna take a while to start 😂
Not any more than the description I read!
Can't wait to graduate from ONU
Guys I just picked up my cap and gown!!!
I'm partial to the Scooby doobie
Boiii i bet
Sorry @Craig Casto :(  and shut up Nick haha
They actually got asked that and Jamie was just kinda like "well nobody really knows" but Adam said emphatically yes
Nah it was q&a stuff but it was still interesting to hear them speak
You're a monster Brian. And yeah it was cool!
That's terrible man I'm so sorry
Yeah what did they tell you?
Wait what...
What...
Tru
That'd be pretty fun actually
I'm watching now. 2-0 :(
Unfortunately no I'm about to go eat but if we​ get home in time I'm gonna put it on. What's the score?
Oh well I won't be home until tomorrow but maybe then?
When?
Wow I hate you. And yeah it's a holiday for you to spend with us
@Niel Skalican 
@poonslayer 
Tru
Yep it's just a sublet from July-late December/early January. I'm using a guy's room who normally lives there
Nah this is for while Julie's still doing her last semester. I'm rooming with two med students at BU
And it is pricey but I've got two roomies
Unit 4 haha. I saw the interior briefly but it looked nice. And it'd better have a stripper pole
IKR I forgot I hadn't talked to you about this!
Just signed my first ever lease 😱
570 Massachusetts Ave
570 Massachusetts Ave, Boston, MA 02118

https://goo.gl/maps/hDAi23zTTAH2
I thought RL meant real life and I was so confused
Haha I think it had something to do with getting a Nexus so you might have it too
Well for whatever reason I have 65GB. 15 might be a bit tight. I'm using 9 now
But Dropbox works too
More than I feel comfortable about. Last time I turned it on neither my trackpad nor my keyboard were working. And I do it through Google drive. You can pick folders on your hard drive to automatically sync
It's rough. I have a lot backed up but it still sucks and if it needs fixed it'll be pricey
Well the code I was working on was only on my laptop. But I borrowed a keyboard and mouse from the library and put it on GitHub so I can work on it wherever now. I just don't want my laptop to be messed up 😞
Keep me in your thoughts everyone...I spilled coffee on my laptop and have a lab due at midnight.
🔥🔥🔥
Haha yeah I'm moving like right after Myrtle Beach. That would be awesome for a round trip
This is julie. Hector recognized me from Instagram hahahsh
Oh get out of here
Uh so????????????????
You could've 🙄🙄🙄
I had no idea. That was awesome
And he recognized Julie 😂😂
Idc that was awesome. Hector Jimenez was with him
Shut up he was so chill
I just shook hands with Justin meram as I left a bar...nbd
I'm at school now but maybe tonight!
Lol yeah I agree. I can get annoyed too but you're right that nobody else really takes people one and that's what annoys me about finlay because he tries sometimes but is way less skilled at it than meram
That was the thought yeah... A little extreme for me but definitely an option in a year or two
I doubt it honestly meram has looked good
I also saw people mentioning putting meram in the center and putting Manneh in his old spot
Yeah I wouldn't be too mad about that honestly. He's looked pretty meh to start the season
@Nick Casto did you see the latest crew trade?
!!
Yeah I didn't think the CW Columbus reached out there actually
Oh boy that was sexy
It's all good famo
On the CW yeah
Woo
IT'S LIT
And he scored!
I know I'm hyped
@Niel Skalican 
The fitness model Julie watches videos of all the time
Nikki blacketter!
Yeah Erin queen was gonna go with us and bailed last minute so we just stayed here
We were going to meet bae AKA Nikki blacketter
Well we were SUPPOSED to be driving back from NYC at that point but that changed today. So I'm real af actually
!
Nothing
WHEN
HYPE AF
Me jamming to passionfruit in the car
I don't think so famo
Keep going I'm so close
Looks like some discrete math to me
I was super confused by that message earlier but yeah I started listening to the album and that's a good one
RIP JULIE
That's literally why she picked duke
Fine I want you to marry her then
We're all Bearcats on this blessed day
Nah I like watching basketball as is but the addition of immediate stakes and a group competition with the brackets makes it pretty easily watchable I think. But more so with an actual team to root for for sure
He's like me lol no college basketball all year but I love march madness because of the bracket competition
But you're safe
You must face the embarrassment
Fair enough, which is why they'll win the whole thing
I'm surprised almost everyone picked Michigan for this game
THE BRACKET LIVES
Well Michigan is up by 30 rn so nothing to worry about there
Yeah according to my bracket UCLA isn't even gonna make it out of this round
Pretty sure I did too
That ND loss hurts
b o i
This goes for everyone. We move as a caravan
Do it
I'm literally moving to MA you dumb
It really is :(
That is a tough situation... And yeah I see what you're saying Nick that if they're out of money there's not much they can do. But definitely a good idea to email about it. I think the email looks fine
It says she can because she filled out that bracket last night but we have a limit of one bracket per person
OR if you can increase the number of brackets we can have so that she can add her good one
Now she's asking if you can delete her old bracket somehow
Julie added the wrong bracket to our group. She's asking @Nick Casto if you can unlock it for her
I'm a dirty traitor I know. But I have to do what it takes to win
But I'm really sorry :(
That belly button tho
Come on Craig none of us do
Nice
It's beautiful isn't it
Seriously. That's horrible
smh I'm sorry Zach
We go to a hockey game together every year you dumb. And yeah what does that mean...
Thanks for the invite bro
Nothing honestly. You here now?
He's up there in Wal-Mart
Also nick I had a busy week sry
lmbo
Fake af
Moi!
Oh well at least you had a reason I thought you really drove all the way down for that on a weekday lol
WHAT like in Columbus??
Omg. And nick that picture won't load for some reason
Yeah they're pretty great
Yep I'm still good
Jeal
Leak was legit 🔥🔥🔥
I'm sorry Craig
You are... So dumb
That was me earlier you dumb
But I'm about to give it back to him 
Logan left his phone at my house bitches
dat Arizona weather tho
Well any preference?
Yeah location-wise it's a big difference. Are the programs similar in structure and whatnot?
Debatable
The only other application was to OSU right?
No matter your choice, having to make a decision is a good problem to have
My man
Yeah I visited Pittsburgh once. It was for only like a day but it was pretty cool
tru. When you say top 40 how high? Like what is really the difference between them?
Pittsburgh is closer to Boston �
Oh well in that case that might be better. I was just gonna say idk how they rank in the program
Also Arizona > Pittsburgh
Congrats though!
fr we're trying to see that schmoney
Meram would be cool
That jersey is still sexy. We're back to the best kit combo in the league
It's gonna be the same as last year
It's gonna be the same as last year
Tchani for sure
And sane
And yeah I hate that I want one bow
Now we need a full checkerboard kit ;)
That checkerboard pattern is so sexy
Omg that's hot. Especially when the sponsor is actually on there right. The Acura logo is cool
Lmao
This is Julie  Logan doesn't want to look. The jersey is sexy but I hate Acura 
I'm scared to look
I have it I just haven't opened it yet
Yeah I haven't played in a bit
Sorry 😂
Well actually Julie and I are gonna be celebrating our anniversary this weekend so...
That's insane I was so confused at first 😂
Yes I'm gonna watch with the kit and everything
I could think about the 25th but I won't be able to this week
Lol I turned the sensitivity up the other day and is too high apparently
Same. I saw the teaser and read that people who have seen the new kit really like ot
"boob"
You were basically a god card
If I remember correctly that card was op tho
That really killed me when he casually drew that card
This is getting out of hand 😂
Thicc Nicc
HB BBY
I don't think I can :/
Okay I'll be sure to tell you �
Oh boy. Well thanks 😂
Umm......what
Oh yeah that was a pretty great game honestly
He's being a little sensitive right now. And you mean like the one we had for ps3?
Yeah that sounds awesome. I've never been skiing
Sign me up
So jealous. And yeah I have heard that nick you should come up
Why am I moving to Boston
Also you've had more snow days in one semester than I've had in four years here
That's crazy that it's normally faster. But McCoy if you haven't heard yet we got 60 down at the house the other day
I think it should now. And getting the full standings and your position
Yeah that part's not working I guess :(
But really you don't have to use his name anymore
Blart's a savage.
How many points does @Brian Hoffman have?
How many points does @Craig Casto have?
Triggered
I believe he said he's a work in progress
You suck McCoy
BLART PLZ
Ooh
I've never met this guy in my life
🤔
What about me Blart?
Uhhh
😎😎😎
😂😂
I missed it 😭
Aww man that sounds p good though
Graeter's makes beer??
Yeah man ark is such a great game
"to have known you"
Also you would 😂
Lol it's all good. That's awesome that it seems like it was pretty chill and based a lot on your interests. Hopefully Microsoft goes similarly.
Yeah I feel like that would be something you'd really enjoy
What was it like?
I forgot those were today. Nice!!
Cambridge, 02139
@Nick Casto truly bffs
Definitely just attacked with a kill
Good times
That's awesome!
If they used a pi you might be right honestly
What language and stuff?
Well I like that I actually do well in MLS but whichever is fine lol
@Niel Skalican
@Niel Skalican
@Niel Skalican 

You can't hide forever.
Sounds fun to me!
Well sign me up whenever it happens please because that was so fun
Lol still though. Your party was the most poppin that night
Girls were flocking to you like a fresh suet cake
You already are man I saw it in person
You got it Nick I believe in you
JUST DO IT
That sounds nice and all but... That body pillow
You wanna be what?
These kinds of things are why Julie makes fun of us for watching that show 😂😂
That's at LEAST as good
Slaying some bday poon
hb
HEY @poonslayer 
@Nick Casto same...Those were THE bus ride songs
Um well I just started yesterday and I know that you can win like box things that open after a certain amount of time but...Not sure how to get them exactly
Probably just in the indoor place because of the cold
And it takes forever but this is different I'm assuming
You just hate it because we play iy
Sounds pretty bomb
😂
And I got that too 
I did actually but haven't played. It's good?
https://youtu.be/qWjNH4pTHbc

Actually me rn
@poonslayer you can get pork katsu bowls at curl now...
I saw some picture of the crew crest in Ghanaian flag colors and it was so fitting lol
Is that fence incredibly sharp?
How did it come down on the fence so hard??
Actually me rn tbh tho...
Well I guess we'll find ouy
I'm down
rekt
I heard a little bit of it on the radio this morning and it was cringe worthy lol
I'm not too picky though if it ends up being a bit more
Yeah that's fair. I'd also say $150-200
What was the cost last year?
And you're really reading that?
I jumped and audibly made some noise of fear on a few occasions and dad was laughing at me but aw man. I might actually try using my headphones and playing the next piece sometime alone just to see how long I can last
Yep that one. And I won't say anything because you can still do the chapter select to pick up from where we left off. But yeah I did one more sixth and oh man I'm glad I didn't do it like tonight at midnight or something
Scarier
So McCoy wasn't lying...That game we got really gets scariee
fr though that's awesome. I'd be so jeal if you got to go to Seattle
mfw Microsoft never even answered me
Sounds like me
Yeah I remember that 😂
Two sigma was the one you took at home right?
Maybe but the good thing is that you get all that time to really think about the problems which I liked a lot
Oh I think just two, maybe 3. But one was being evaluated on runtime and to pass completely I had to learn a new concept for it lol but that was pretty cool. I actually watched some open courseware videos to figure it out
Also a week, that's why I asked
Haha nice. Well let me know what the questions are on it. I wonder how similar they are to the ones I had
@poonslayer yeet do you have a whole week to do it?
The home ones?? Yeah that's some dumb scheduling
I saw! There's like one good away game per month
Pretty long but doable. And yeah I was thinking of the cool new stadium
New York or Atlanta would be my picks of the driving distance ones
I'd say come up to watch them play the revs but that's not the nicest stadium experience to visit lol
Same. Regardless though I think going to an away game would be awesome to do again
That's definitely be preferable but obviously that won't be doable for everyone
Yeah I don't think I'd really wanna drive...
Same I've wanted to visit the Pacific Northwest for a while. And either place would be awesome for a soccer game
I would absolutely love that 
Also Brian...One time?
I'm a sucker for lion metaphors
Hey now that's extreme
But I mean I don't think it's wrong of you to be a bit concerned
You can cry on my shoulder man... is okay
Her
I see what McCoy's saying and if it were me I might just trust it but at the same time you have a right to be uncomfortable and to express that to hee
Exactly. If it's really that little just give her that money or something lol. I'd take that over the alternative
Like Niel said it could def cause a conflict
@Brian Hoffman are you 100% sure that she would only be paying like $25 more? Because in that case you could argue it but otherwise idk..
Fun ((:)
Fun :)))
Because hiding things only makes it seem suspicious
Yeah like maybe she just didn't want to say anything because she didn't want to worry you and is truly just concerned about the money but... You need to tell her that when it comes to something like that that she should be open with you
That's p sketch...
Yeah I like the white
Ours is the next week
That's a long spring break
Plz see my snap to you
Also I finally know who your avi is!!
It was a wonderful experience and I'm at least 50% gayer for it
@poonslayer...I finished
🤔🤔🤔
Yeah what..
Yeah I would. And then pay off stuff for my family, find a nice place to live, and chill and save money for a life with no work and travel
I gotchu
We're good whenever today btw
Incline??
I'd prefer tomorrow tbh. Sorry Craig :(
Doesn't matter to me
I thought you couldn't tonight?
I'm v down
As in tomorrow?
I'm down whenever! I'll be busy Friday evening but any night is good with me
Nice
Wow he said he was hanging with your grandparents
Niel's here and Julie's on her way
At least you're a champ
Shut up
That's cool Zach and nah Niel 16 should be fine
Yes Niel and no unless someone else has 17
Yep it'll be lit
Well McCoy already showed up so you're good
Me neither it's gonna be a skilled battle
Or at least it can be and YES to lil c's
It's tonight
Yep everyone feel free to come over whenever!
All good fam
Early but idk when. I was thinking everyone could stay tonight so we can all get up and go
Well I think Niel and I are gonna go downtown tonight and you're free to come with us @Nick Casto.
Probably around 2 or so
?
Haha I know I'm jk. I can go pick you up later. I'll let you know when I can head out. You're good whenever!
Well sorry see ya next year I guess
Anyone wanna hang with McCoy, Niel, and I today?
Yep sounds like we're good to go!
👍
Not tonight but any other day
Are you in cbus now?
Yessir
Nothing on Thursday for me
Idk about EVERYTHING
YES
But that being said I'm 101% sure
This isn't a competition craig
😂
I was gonna say you weren't even there 
Lol I'm sure we talked. Either way I had an awesome time
We hung out the whole night??
I haven't taken one step in the house without them on
I asked for the exact same kind for Christmas 😂
It doesn't have to be everyone together just whoever wants to hang
I want to. I'm not doing anything so I'm free whenever
@Niel Skalican since you've got us muted
thx bby
I've been exfoliating
So right now we're 5/7
Okay cool
McCoy and I have ours
:(  It's all good I just wanna make sure we can get together for that and then we can deal with jerseys another time if we need to. What about everyone else?
So is new year's Eve morning still good for everyone for the SOCCER classic?
Yeah we haven't opened yet either
Yeah man come on over
smh I could've told her that
January 9
Mine are usually an hour 45
ONE MORE SEMESTER 🎉🎉🎉
Hey same time as me!
They're scared of the truth
Craig that is just false and HA
Well Julie agrees with me so that's one for the good fight
Yeah... The specific GARLIC kind
YOU TOO REALLY
*Ridiculous
You guys are difficult
And it's also that plain, thick bread you buy for French toast
The wiki page says they were originally just large pieces grilled and buttered...still no garlic
How would you even know that
Toast is just toast!!! Sure you can put garlic and butter on it but the TOAST is just bread
Think canes
Texas toast is not always garlic bread
A selfie?
Nick I saw Donnie's snap story so I know what you're talking about now and...you're wrong
2 HYPED
@poonslayer I'M OFFICIALLY IN CAMBRIDGE
0 down 3 to go
Going for that sneaky good pick
It was sorta lame and no you don't
J cole with the winner
I figured you would
Dat save tho
WHAT A HIT
Moi
You just let me know
You just said it was gonna be a banger!
If you don't want me to come up then fine
I've never been though!
Looks like I'm coming up to Ada
What I was so looking forward to it 😭
This Thursday night tho 😎
😂
What would that even mean 
Yep I wanna live downtown no matter what. Julie agrees that back bay looks nice 😉
Hoping for Cambridge tho 🙏🙏
Yeah there's that and another that are about the same distance outside of Boston. So it could be any of the three
😃😃😃  Unfortunately it's not 100% I end up at that specific office :(
rly
Also jfc
It takes time to grow into a seasoned comedian like your big bro
Btw I'm all about mercilessly sucking
What a weeb amirite
Yep that's it I just looked it up
Well I don't mean the main one but some version like 2 or 3
Weren't some on ESPN this year?
My jersey has arrived! Am I the first?
Yeahhh she did say that so good call
No idea. One of my mom's students. She just said that it seemed insane how many medications he had to take so she wanted me to see what you guys said
What about all of it at the same time?
So @pharmacypeople is this safe
Nick... No one is impressed
Wow I haven't even had one yet. But I did just finish my last class!
Well I can go!
Okay cool
Hey so Myrtle Beach would be what days again?
@Niel Skalican 
@Craig Casto 
smh yes
Okay new year's Eve thrn
Let's do new year's morning. Kick off the year with some friendly competition
Yes
Yeah I could do it after Christmas since that might work best
Were there symptoms that made them check or something?
Not good. I'm sorry
I'm here now
IT BEGINS
Why'd you have to ruin it Brian
I know I do
Imma check that out ASAP
Well let me know if you hear anything. I've just been trying to see from Twitter and yik yak
Way too scary man
The only new thing I know is that they locked down campus so nobody can get in. From pictures it looks there there are a million cop cars and ambulances
Yeah it's serious. At least 7 people in the hospital
There's at least one shooter on campus
I just see a bunch of cop cars and ambulances outside the window. I'm in the library like a block away from where everything's happening
I just see a bunch of cop cars and ambulances outside the window. I'm in the library like a block away from where everything's happening
I won't. But man this is scary.
I'm about to leave campus now
Lol Julie's roommates said the exact same thing
Nah I got to use it luckily lol. But yeah they escorted me out after I was trying to leave
There were some people in the bathroom waiting because apparently quite a few guys hop over because of the lines :(
Not fun. But at least they won
I watched until halftime at a tailgate and then Julie came out and we went back to her place. But yeah I was so mad I looked forward to this game all year
I still had like 20 people in front of me though. And there are other bathrooms but I'd already been in that like for the whole second quarter and felt like that was the closest I was gonna get
I guess I should've. I really didn't know what to do lol I've never had to pee so bad in my life
Yes lol and no clue I guess he just slipped by
Yep 😑😑😑
Yep. End of the first quarter I went to pee and waited 30 minutes in like and still had like 10 minutes to go. It hurt so bad I thought I was gonna pass out. This guy behind me went into the women's bathroom and came back out and said it would be cool and I was so desperate i did it and there was security in the bathroom and they kicked me out and my ticket wouldn't scan back in
Yes because I barely got to see the game 😑
Craig: "We should just drive out right now to Chicago, knock on @poonslayer's door...wait."
Not sure but I already told them you guys would be here at 7
There are people still here but you should be fine
Nice job @Nick Casto 
That's cool with me!
Yeah I think that'll work. We just got done eating
Aww man. Well it's up to you but I'd be happy if you came
Would you go to campus with me tomorrow?
I already said me!
I will. I'm not sleeping
Plus nick I wanted you to come to campus with me tomorrow
Tell him to Uber up there
Somewhere around there. I'll give you guys a heads up
👍
Well just so you know we're not doing anything NOW because my family is doing Thanksgiving today
Why not??
I'm down! And yeah I'm gonna be getting to campus early for sure for gameday and everything
I didn't look much but the one I wanted I couldn't find :(
So proud ❤
Idk what's happening but I love it
Because of a loss to Mexico and then an embarrassing loss to Costa Rica both in world cup qualifying
This is an /r/MLS dream come true
Wow RIP Jurgen
Oh I didn't even know he had a gf. Imma look her up on fb
Nathan has 0 game
Ohh...I thought you meant to my house
Then why did you ask if it needed provided??
1234 McCoy's Fake AF Ave.
I hate you but yis
I think I just have my priorities straight
@Craig Casto 
Nathan's my guy
It was good @Brian Hoffman. The team wasn't too bad and we didn't get as much done as we wanted but it was a good timr
Me neither Niel. And plz
I'm v down. Also sorry for not texting you back yesterday B ri
Especially on top of Friday...
Yeah I saw that too earlier. Nate said it would be sooner rather than later
I didn't watch the game so I can't make a full judgement but... Pretty bad result
I love that meme 😂
If it makes you feel better, my break starts the 23rd
He's not :(
We've been friends!
What do we need to say again? Just jerseys we have and what we don't want?
Yeah we prob should. My fav time of the year!
You getting a new one?
On
In
I just got off work but I'm bout to turn it in
Yeah I'm not a big fan of Matlab either 😂😂  And yeah brian I was gonna tell you when we ate lunch but you had to go and cancel!
MathWorks!
I've got an interview tomorrow in Natick!
😉
@poonslayer 
I do wanna go but...that's a lot
Shut up I have the supporters shield for this year. The true trophy
wtf why would it not do the playoffs IN THE PLAYOFFS
Wait that's the end?
my guy
LMAO
Fake af
I don't have a snap bruh
You're forgiven I just bonged a whole case
Even better!
Nothing wrong with some tequila shots. I think she sounds like a peach
Interesting...so what we're getting at here is that she might not be bad at all. Which is it then??
Sorry not negative but almost 0
Depending on the values of k, x, and t...she might be negative bad soo...I don't see  the problem
Brian rn
nbd
Apparently. I didn't know where he was before but he's on the OSU soccer team now
Oh haha well there ya go. That's funny actually because I just found out the other day that Matt appel is in one of my classes
I know that's Joey on the right but... Not sure about the other guy
That's awesome that you actually got to use those
I did actually and videos of it are awesome lol
Young Nug
Also brian that's the dumbest quiz I've ever seen...and I'm 27 apparently
Honestly though regarding the format...I think I'm gonna have to agree with Niel. It's really different sounding but I would definitely find it exciting I think. I'd have to see it in practice though
I'm just saying they shouldn't have hosted before, so they shouldn't in this case
Things like the world cup and Olympics have only ever been worth it for like a handful of countries so that's kind of on them to be honest and not bid
You could argue that those countries shouldn't be doing it with the current format either.
Yes 😂😂
What do you mean?
Of course!
Lmao I wish I'd make all kinds of money from that
🤘🤘🤘
Shoulda been lil dicky
❤💜💙
Submitted 😎
Also did you say the cheapest seats?
Okay. Are you and Craig just applying for one ticket?
Nice thanks. I'm gonna do it now
Don't get my hopes up like this
I know lol. But whatever might as well finish the season strong to get some momentum for next year
Crew MLS cup champs confirmed
Two wins in a row...
👍
So if anything you could stream it on fox sports' website
Actually sorry it's on FS1 today
Looks like BCSN2 if you have it
Miss u 2 bae
Yeah that's about my max too but it would be a pretty awesome experience!
I probably will. How much do you think tickets will be?
Nope
Nah fam. Are you here or something?
Yeah that's crazy to think about
Wowwwww
Man I was really rooting for the upset too
Please do I'm dying of laughter
That's cool and all but...keisuke Honda
Not sure but I can ask him later
I don't remember the exact date but someone during the last week of September
That man had a family
Exciting! And sorry Zach :(
The hype is REAL
Yeah my mom told me!
👀👀
I hate you so much 😂
Greatest moment of my summer tbh
Oh yeah well look what I saw on the bus this morning
Wow
Pumped
That looks ridiculous
@poonslayer look at dad's
😏
Pixie kitten  😺
The sequel
Okay so is he using that ticket then?
Wait so you are going to the game?
I still haven't gotten an answer lol she went to sleep early and hasn't gotten up yet. And when?
Well she hasn't answered but I'll let you know
Umm let me ask Julie first. Thank you!!
I'd be v down for that
😂😂  It does look pretty nice
glhf
*affect

And most likely keep the kid but you'd have to ask me if that ever actually happened
Yeah I was gonna say for that I'd probably keep the kid
Yeah just saying McCoy hasn't finished yet
Tag your spoilers guys
Proud of you nick
😂😂
That's pretty awesome. And yeah I do too
loganpatino10@gmail.com
If we need to then it's okay with me
I finally watched this and it was so cringeworthy
same
Want to join?
Harvest Moon cafe
Yaaaas. I'm good to chill whenever but I think McCoy, Julie, and I are going to get breakfast first
Lol
Let's just do top 4 make it look
We can just do 5 teams. And yeah what do you mean?
Yeah I saw it the other day and that's pretty wild. I would've been pretty happy if we signed him
That is true I guess
I wish :((
Sorry working
I asked Julie and autumn is in Colorado and Barry is gone
Also we can just have my parents as a last resort. Or tell uncle d to make an appearance haha
Tell her to bring a partner and she's in
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Yep @Nick Casto it's a Chromecast
Whenever is fine with me!
I'm down
Alright well come whenever
Soccer golf at 8 I just got here
Yeah dva got buffed in the last patch and is supposed to be pretty good now actually. And roadhog is pretty cool even though I suck with him. Alright anyway I'm about to leave so I'll see you guys soon!
SO NOT LEGENDARY BUT STILL LIT. JEALOUS
YOO WHAT IS THAT LEGENDARY??
And yet here I am
Also I just went to change my fantasy team and didn't realize the week already started on Wednesday 😑😑
That was a great album. I miss old Bobby 😔
That's a Kanye line noob
Yeah I might be back too late I'm leaving around 6:30 probably
???
Where's this coming from??
Yeah like 8-9 would be good for me
Honestly I'd be okay with that as a last resort
😔
That's cool, that place was really nice
Oh no I was just wondering. That's the place we went for the crew thing isn't it?
That's where we're going?
Oh yeah I didn't even notice! 13th!!
GO POLAR BEARS. And yeah I'd like to go early if possible because I told Julie I'd help her move in to her place sometime that day
That would match up with the amount of games we played last year AND people would get more guaranteed games because of the group stages. Plus the last thing is with 12 the skill level would be higher probably because we don't have to worry about just filling the numbers. The skill is good now and we could definitely get one other good team
Alright guys I have a thought on the volleyball tournament that I want your opinion on. 

The tournament is really soon and we have 10/16 people. We might not be able to get 6 more, but I think this could be a good thing. If we get just one more team, that gives us the option of doing either a 2-table round robin with the top 4 advancing or a single round robin with the same top 4. We could also do a double round robin with either of those and
Still tho you're about to be the first with a charmeleon
Disgusting
😪😪
smh
Bruh
You know it fam
$32 each and I have them as mobile tickets so I can just get us in unless you want me to send them to you to print or something
Yeah the water was pretty choppy so you could get some air today too lol my knees and back are so sore
It was super fun those things go really fast
Just at lake erie
I did tho 😉

💛💙💜💚❤
I'll take down a bear for us
Yeah I was hoping they were pins or something but I just put it on my key rink and it works pretty well
I can go out later and try to grab more. I didn't want to take too many yet in case other people wanted them but I'll go in an hour and grab you one. Anyone else?
I went to the pokestop at work and there was a bag of 3D printed emblems for each team for people to take
Jeal
???
Possibly, yeah. I thought you could claim them all from the app but I could be wrong. I'll try the gmail account next time
You're good. Which one should I use from now on?
same with the campsite money
nicholas_casto@yahoo
Alright Nick I sent you mine and Julie's money. Also you have yet to claim money I sent you for shades the other day
McCoy you da real MVP
The tickets are $32 each and that's to me
Yeah it's $11 a person. I'll send you the cash soon\
So nick what's the final price per person for the campsite?
No prob. What class is the paper for and what's it studying?
You need to ask her how many times she's gotten the answer "to be the best, like no one ever was" to the question "what is your goal in pokemon go?"
I filled it out! And okay good
So @Craig Casto do I try and return this ticket or nah?
I'm fine either way. We might just have to play it by ear and see how we feel Monday morning
Oh wow that's awesome. Works for me then!
That price is good thougu
Well that's up to you I'm cool either way
So Craig can you go or do I need to try and return this ticket?
Me!
That's cool with meN
Yep
American dollars. Also Craig 😑
Yep they have been purchased
Alright guys I'm getting the tickets now. With the service fee it's $32 a ticket
We're gonna go ahead and stay and come back on monday
I can go ahead and order them in a few minutes. I'll let you guys know what you owe me
Lol Nick just texted me that he was gonna order them tonight
Here we go again
OLA. OLA OLA. OLA OLA.
T TCHAN!!
Think of it like golf
It's all good we've been playing a lot lol
18
what is that avatar
So many water pokemon 😳
YES CRAIG
I think they've been down a bunch today
Brian no but I'm gonna get it asap and I will of course be picking bulby as well
So in the front of my building there's a rock that they paint a lot and it's a pokecenter. And I went out with some people to get some items and there were like 5 others guys there doing the same thing 😂
It looks like you can't battle other people at all
Wow...I really need to get this
Yeah it's just a time hassle and I'll miss some new features but if it's really worth it I'm down
BRUH
Lol all the pressure's on him he talked about it so much. Nick let me know if it's worth it
Yeah I found that out very sadly. I'm debating on whether or not to downgrade to try it out because it said it won't be supported until the official release which is like a month or two away
Guys Pokemon go is out now
Wow missing out again
The earliest I could get back would be like 7:30 and that's a bit late. It's all good we can hang out that night and the next day
Eh probably not actually
What time this Friday? I might be able to make it
I'm down for the 21st
Well... Thursday or Saturday maybe?
I really wanna get this figured out because we've gotta go
😑
Yo @Nick Casto @Craig Casto @Brian Hoffman check if anytime between July 16 and 23 cedar point would work. I can take any weekday off and McCoy should be free whenever so it's up to you guys
😐
GOLAAAAA
He's diving in 
Listerine is good thinking
Ah... Well you know what good for him
How do you buy listening?
Well we've got next weekend at least
So we're really not gonna hang this weekend? 😭
@Nick Casto @Craig Casto wyd tonight
Maybe he's just really excited all the time
I don't blame you that's terrifying lol
😳😳
Oh yeah... Great choice by me 😂
2 months would be so annoying lol. Which laptop do you have again?
I do not, sorry :(  That's a pretty unfortunate issue lol
#blessed
Ah...man I wish I could I'm gonna miss him too 😢
What?
Def
Hey now Myrtle Beach was a fun time. And we've got the next two weekends!
Somehow I'm not surprised
A champion knows all the rules of his competition
Nick how are you gonna say that when I actually WON last year. This is all skill. My record is no fluke.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
bruh
How is it?
I'LL BE HOME THIS WEEKEND!!!
I probably will!
Same tbh
?
I just got some practice for this year's William A Trapp award 😎
Woooooooow idk if anyone's watching this euros game but shaquiri just scored an amazing bike
I hate that I found that so funny
That's my boi
That's pretty funny Niel and Zach that was 10/10
?
So one of them just tries to meg everyone
Who are you
This field sucks wow. And yeah same but Argentina and Chile are both in good form
Basically... This tournament is super lame
Agreed.
All my copa America dreams crumbling one by one
Nope I wish :(  They're showing it at work though and a bunch of people are here watching
Wtf
This is the greatest and worst thing I've ever heard at the same time
It is so accurate 😂
We're watching the end of the game again at the Monday morning meeting 😂
*last year
This time today we were on our way down to Myrtle!
That was so wild
Like whenever you get started? Yeah I won't be crazy high level or anything lol
Nice. It's exactly the same as before
McCoy did you do the old school one?
You might be right. I just remember playing for like a week with those names
Wasn't I Amish son?
Wait isn't that guy good??
BOOL12
Seriously?? Wow. And this is just for the old school version
Yep not too shabby!
And tutorial island takes 20 years
Yeah the nostalgia is real
Ohh yeah. Level 3 cooking already 😎
It was packed. So happy for them this is a great tournament for us!
PKs 😭😭😭
Take a road trip and see brian and then me
So dumb 😂  Who celebrates a 7th anniversary anyway
AND IT'S COLOMBIA COME ON
James almost with the weak foot
When you get that first paycheck and just wanna make gainz
We don't but that's why we've gotta make one!! And it's a fantasy mmorpg so you'd like it. And we play together. I used to play it 24/7 back in middle school lol
My bff
Lame
Although we'll see some roommates might be gone
Nice that's probably for the best haha
Well I have a full and a couch...not a whole lot but we've gotta figure this out because it's gonna be crazy
Yessss it was so fun I lost my voice and didn't even realize it
Please man it's wild right now
Not my fault
Booo
What s beautiful night
Also jswi 😂😂
👀👀👀
It's wild here
I'll take a 16 point lead into halftime
Yeah come on now
Yeah this is a great start
I'm jeal. I won't be able to see it probably
Goals
What is this
Gotcha 😂
I'm going to a bar downtown. And yeah Nick don't complain. Also Zach really?
It's pretty good. I'm just now getting started actually working on stuff. A little overwhelming right now to get used to but it's a cool place
I know I'm as shocked as you 😊  And hey I've watched the finals
I'll send pics. It's about to be lit
Ya mane time to watch some cavs action downtown
Back when it wasn't about fancy graphics 
Exactly it's the nostalgia
That's fine if you do I def will. Not tonight tho
Sign me up 😂
I made fun of her more for falling asleep during the world cup final than anyone so you're good 😂
Lol I'll watch it at lunch. I just saw the title and chuckled 😂
Yeah atmosphere and saying I went would be cool. And I'll watch that later
It still could be fun to see buy I wouldn't jump at the chance basically 
Yeah I've heard it on videos before haha. From seeing big Sean I know that live rapping is more yelling than on recordings and I know Drake doesn't sing quite that well lol
I just know Drake won't sound the same live lol
Oh that's not too bad. But yeah even though I like Kanye I don't think I'd necessarily go to a concert. Kinda like with drake
I bet tickets are expensive 😕  when though?
Just chilling at home for a bit before driving back to Cleveland tbh haha nothing crazy
Thanks!! ❤❤
Zach I am so sorry 😭  have they said why?? And Brian someone in the family has FS1 on their cable 😎
Yeah I'm hoping at this point Colombia just wins out to help out
Gol de Colombia 
Yes and you are dumb
The dagger 
Yep I'd say so! Already it's been good for me to be up here forced to meet new people and see new things
Pretty good! No actual work just a lot of onboarding stuff but all the people were really nice and my team seems cool. I won't actually be doing real work for a bit because all the development interns have class to get us up to speed with the main coding language for the rest of the week and then vacation lol
Well there's a bright side at least. That was a nice header
To be fair I don't think Casey did anything
Sigh
A little but I'm excited to get a routine going. Even though I'm leaving in 3 days 😂
Starts tomorrow at 9! 
Yep!
Alright. Meet there at 7 👍
Yes bring extra. Meet there?
Well if you would like Nick and I to join that's the only option 
Let's do it
7 am works for me
That's what a champion does 
Same but it'll definitely be exciting
I know I keep checking because I want it to take as long as possible lol
Also lol
Well it might've just been the heat of the moment or something... because I didn't even hear anything about it. 
What for?
This table is about to get very condensed
OOOOOLLLLAAA
Bald
Band
Niel's name in that picture I sent is Mister Meat 😂😂😂
I'm looking to get this sex beef wet
Yeah but i somehow forgot to change my team so I'm not too confident. And my captain pick is already really bad
I'm in a slump right now 😭
SEX BEEF
Lame
I read that he wasn't 100% but yeah he hasn't done much
I love how the ref just shook his head at him
Shakira 
I will be!
Pretty tempting tbh
Nah I wish
Sure bring her along
What is that gif from
And you can tell him I said that
Weaksauce
David? dang 
Me, you, McCoy, and David. I have to text him and see if he can though 
Wanna play some v ball?
Aww man that sucks 
Yo @Nick Casto when do you get off work and @Craig Casto are you working at all?
Ya do it
The passports have been ordered!
I just saw a preview for a doctor strange movie and it stars Benedict cumberbatch!
We tried but we got there like 5 minutes too late lol. We'll be able to do it tomorrow 
VIEWS
Yeah Craig said it was looking worse 😓
Cool with me
If you wanna help sure!
Cool with me boi
I'm down
Yeah...
Johnson as a defender has me worried but I like the lineup
https://youtu.be/VkF3ur72ZgI

This needs to happen at a crew game
Alright
Well you'll be the only one so it really doesn't matter. And idk since it started raining again
Yeah lol like I said you don't have to
It's all up to you. And that's awesome I'm pumped to ride it
@Craig Casto if you really wanna help out with the sand it's all here
How was it?
...what
I never knew that one tbh
HB BRIAN 
Well I'm sure the crew still want some home field advantage 
And yeah
I worry that they're not taking it seriously though
Lame but hey at least it's still close
That's valid I think
Well it was Guatemala. And it's not quite a soccer city yet but maybe some day
What is your problem 
Come on now
I see what you mean Nick but I think they'll be able to drum up some support because of the whole Ohio thing. And there will be traveling fans
I think people will be excited since Cincy has made a big splash and it's an Ohio team
Yeah I just saw that too. I'm glad it's here but I would've made the trip
Please do because I'll for sure go to the game
There'll be plenty of fans at crew stadium. Assuming they make it past Tampa bay
Crew were drawn to play the winner of FC Cincy and Tampa Bay at home 😁
MLS > USL
You beat an NPSL team by 1
Honestly we're rooting for you so we can smash you
I just saw that!
LET'S DO IT
Whenever you get off work. We're gonna start volleyball around 2:30
Craig you're invited to this get together btw
It's actually his friend's so he's only been borrowing it
Well I don't want you to spend the money on it because we won't have it after today
Down for that as well!
I'm down
Tomorrow 
Volleyball + sleepover tomi
Invitation to everyone: volleyball/spikeball tomorrow at Brian's
ggjk
Yo b-ri we finally have your jersey 😉
Still rocking the socks
Lexi?
Nice!
I most likely will too!
Yeah I saw that. That's dumb
😭
@Zach Spangler 
Let's do it
Alright when you send it to me I'll head out
Yep it's cool with me. I'm just gonna change real quick and I'll try to leave by 7
Yep we just got back. You still want me to come get you?
Well I'm heading to the gym now so...I'll let you know
#BENDTNER2CBUS
Really? What time?
I'm v down
What he really wants is a challenge... Aka Columbus!!
Dumb
I will in case I don't feel like buying anything. And onu for sure
Same that's exciting! I might have to get a shirt there because like the only orange thing I have is a drogba ivory coast Jersey and that would feel pretty fake
That's the plan!
Wow I saw stuff last night about trading to Vancouver. Didn't expect it to be an Eastern team
I think McCoy might wanna go too
That's for nick, you, and I?
Yeah I'm down to come
👎
@Craig Casto you coming tonight?
Hey Nick can you meet us here at 5?
😳😳
Uhhhh idk what did you have in mind?
Yeah!
You still could've told us 😭
Why do you not tell us this?? 😑😑
YAS I thought you were coming back Wednesday??
😁😁 Brian you're back tomorrow right?
We should play it this week! And good brian!
Yep!
What do you mean?
Yeah I don't know why I thought it'd be that easy haha. Brian would you be down??
I know. But hey they play again July 31 at Toronto again. We could do that!
I really do too. My dad just said it takes a while to get your passport renewed...
Who else would be down??
Their stadium renovations look awesome and it could be a first away game experience!
I might have to get it renewed. But I could do that in time I'm sure!
Guys let's go to the away game at Toronto on the 21st
�
Wtf...
4 goals, a 3 goal lead, and we still manage to tie
What do you mean for whatever reason?? 😡  I'm glad he liked me he and Nick were cool and I was hoping I made a good impression lol. And he's officially a crew fan now
If so I'm out of the running
There will be 5 of us right?
I missed it but wow Bayern's out
Valid point
Seems fitting that someone is their biggest fan 



@Brian Hoffman 
Also Nick what'd Tottenham do?
http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/the-unrelenting-charlie-davies-documentary-espn

Really good short documentary on Charlie Davies if anyone's interested.

Well you know how a crew jersey looks
You got a jersey?
FINALLY

I could do any time in May
Zach that's crazy congrats
Well I should be good to go

3.5 or greater
>= 3.5
Also I have not been there
Oh yeah that's not gonna happen for me haha. How about all Dean's list?
2 points 😂  You're so annoying
Nah you're selling yourself short. But you even like math/science so it doesn't matter anyway!
I barely do math. Come do CS
Oh wow lol. I barely ever have to write papers for my classes and they're never that long
Nah my finals shouldn't be that bad I don't think
With the 2nd most total points
Craig...the new cellar dweller
Yep dey here
Alright cool yeah I completely forgot
Oh yeah I still have it...
Yep! I'll be there at 5!
Oh I can just meet you at melt if that's cool

GO INTO THE SUPERMARKET...CLEARANCE RACK...THERE YOU IS THE COLD TURKEY

Slither.io

You mean melt as in the grilled cheese place?
Julie said to send that to her lol
My baby I'm so proud 😍😍
I just got what that meant omg 😂
Okay yeah let's do that
I'll probably be good unless you wanna get something
Money has been sent ✅
Oh nice yeah that sounds perfect. And how much is Myrtle Beach again? I can send you that and the ticket money now
$20 right?
Yeah mane
Been blazing since midnight 🔥🔥🔥
It is truly amazing
I'm looking now and it says you tied
"Blood curl"
GO CRAIG
If you want sure. It does look really fun I've seen some people play it at school
My mom was talking about that the other day!! She even said we should get it for the beah
Oh I know 😍  We're watching that game now!
No I just saw what happened though!
😪 Against?
That's really cool that you can walk by and see that
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
What's a defense
YEEEEAAAAJHHH FINLAY
3-1 CREW
Fight me rn
Nah I'm keeping my crown
😭😭😭
Yeah just go ahead and give it to her
Omg this whole time I thought it was for tonight's game 😂😂😂
Wait what?
Will I be able to get it from her to get in?
Why don't you go to crew games? You could see me then
?
Picking it up whereM
Also Nick...can I buy that ticket from you or nah
Zach it's looking like at least 15000 for the FC cinci game. You've gotta go that's pretty awesome
You should!
Sorry 😭
Ohh I'm chilling with Julie for most of the night 😕  I will buy that ticket though! 
About the tickets?
It's all good. My feet are all blistered so I don't mind a break haha
If you really want then yeah I can play fo sho
Really? I'd be down
Soccer at the fields tonight if anyone wants to join
fr that song was 🔥🔥
Another classic
They were still underdogs though
Yeah it's not that they're not good but most people would choose city over Atletico in a game
I meant Atletico
That may be true but most people would agree that they're better than befica
They are not
It'd be awesome if they played the crew in the open cup
Yeah I'll let you know
My guy
powerpuffyourself.com 

And that's real tempting
Creg 😂😂
It's a good time with your bros
Thank you Niel
"Nobody knows how to play golf"

"Nobody is capable of running a marathon"
Nick you just think you're better than everyone else
I'm assuming not
I can hit a ball anywhere I want
I'm always down for a nerdy board gamr
I'm always ready
SAYS YOU
More like 1 move 
Oh yeah we'll just have a 15 minute party!
Nick I would but we're gonna be leaving at like 4:30 in the morning tomorrow for McCoy's MIT weekend thing
Later bby 😉
Coming along swimmingly if I do say so myself
😉
Thicc
I love the second man city one
Craig's new bæ
($10)
Could I get 0.005% ownership please?
I wish lol you could literally do more than him in a minute. 
I know that feel... For my class where we have to make an Android app we've got like a month left and one guy hasn't written a single line of code
You could just send it to him with Google wallet
Well I'm good just give me your email
Oh boy lol. What's your email I can send it now
Wait why so much??
And fine with me
🙋
I'll be done and ready by then so we good
Yeah I do wanna go eat somewhere. As for picking me up...can you come around the bend of the RPAC again?
Yeah I saw that crew season ticket holders got dibs and was hoping you didn't have a small limit lol because I plan on going to that too
So excited 😁
12:30. I'll just go to the gym right after that and be done with my day
I'm gonna have to hold you back omg
That would be so disappointing...
manning_face.mp3
*.jpg
^fake af
I picked Diaz though 😉
That was a good pick. That's who Craig has too
They are playing Colorado... Who'd you pick Brian?
Also, shots fired to @Craig Casto and @Niel Skalican 
To be fair, that strategy won me the league last year
You're 2-1 get outta here
Always a solid pick
Craig did you submit that
It definitely wouldn't be ideal...the sad part is I really don't have a lot of faith in them right now
@poonslayer 
I haven't either but I've heard of him
Wow
So ugly
I'm gonna start watching again soon
Thanks fam
👍👍👍
But really Nick that's fine with me it's only fair I give you something. Like you said it was expensive lol
$5000?
Nice it sounds like a fun time. Honestly I'm done with stuff at like 2 so it doesn't matter to me
Yeah that would work for me! What time would you wanna pick me up?
Then I will take it. Would we able and to ride together? I'll pay you $50 and split parking
😂😂  Zach if you do wanna go you can have it
Lol well how much was it? I don't wanna take it free
👀👀 why do you have an extra?
It's free?
Well I'm not watching but when I saw your message I was pretty much completely neutral so idk if that says anything. But if I had to pick I'd prefer the us win
I don't know how to feel about this. Also Brian i haven't listened yet but I plan on it
It is a pretty good roster but yeah they're both away so I'm giving Colombia the edge with that one even though I only know like one guy on their team
Love that kit. I'm gonna say... 2-0 USA and 2-1 Colombia over the baby nats 😕
Predictions?
REPPING MY US GEAR RN
You're not wrong...
Disrespectful
#BoomerSooner
It did make me laugh 😂
Did you actually mean her?
Your honorable mention 😂😂😂
I respect it but no way she's top 5
Also Brian I saw an article that said something about tickets starting at $35 but don't quote me on that
Dem hips tho
And yeah I just randomly remember thinking she was hot 😂  I had to look her up
That was hard to choose honestly. But good picks on Emma Stone and Anna kendrick

She's the recent bae I don't really wanna order it tbh
1. Ariana Grande
2. Zooey Deschanel
3. Mila Kunis
4. Natalie Portman
5. Lacey Chabert
Duh, you've gotta stand up for your bf
http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/sports/2016/03/21/0321-columbus-to-host-soccer-match.html
Yeah new England left me down bad 😔
Tonight would be perfect for me but I don't think anyone else could.. 
Who's chillin?
Wow sportscenter? WE MADE IT
But they're the only way Niel is gonna stay out of last place
I never do
Video or I don't believe it
ily2
That game was so meh. And they just cannot win
Well. Looks like the Yale dream is over
Lol alright that's fine
Coo coo
Like get there then?
Up to you! We're free now we can head over there around 6?
Nick pizza is on Julie's parents 😉
Of course!
No that's fine with me! It's her offer actually
My guy. And okay that's cool
She's got the house to herself
Bball and chill at Julie's tonight? We can bring clix
Florida
Well I'm not making any excuses, they just weren't good this year
😔😔😔
I have no shame it's a good school
Ohio pride
F L Y E R S
Yeah mine's almost over 😭😭😭
Oh I don't blame you I put mine together in a minute or two
Craig are you that last place bracket in the group?
Yeah I was feeling Seton Hall hard
Also that guy was so done 😂
Yeah we're doing cedar point
Not by then I don't start until June 1st
No we have not. And idc I'm down for that though. Also Niel we never got it actually figured out
Don't apologize to him
Hey Nick
Oh...I know. Except I'm gonna lose this Arizona vs Wichita state game
I'm always down to chill
thx guys
You snooze you lose pal
sUcK iT
It's usually around now. There should still be people there on spring break
The field's always open Craig
Yeah on the bright side the Bayern juve game is pretty good
Well 😕
So Nick you're team #wengerout?
I remember when you guys were obsessed with her back when we played for pride because of that show
Those eyes
So jeal
Love her 😩
It looks funny
It does 😂
20g 😂😂
Why?
Also Brian I think that's a thing
That made me laugh so hard for some reason
Oh yeah they're cool but we're 0-2 with them... I mean let's face the facts they're cursed
The new kits are bad juju
Aww man we went. You didn't miss much though
Yeah... That was disappointing. Were you at the game?
HB ZSWAG
Did you sit down though?
Have you heard anything back from those two?
Sorry fam 😪
At this point just keep letting it go. I don't understand how you surpassed me so greatly in the beard growing department
I love it though
O Canadaaaaaa
Coming right up fam
Yeah the raptors one is pretty cool
Prob next weekend
Which weekend?
Niel my spring break is next week
Oh man I remember that pic. That's like sophomore year wow
Well then there is no helping you 😂
No but at least pick up one or two of thrm
So many
Giovinco, larin, piatti, feilhaber...
Other than Kamara you have nobody on your team that is an obvious point getter
Yeah that's a start...
How's that working for ya
I'm sorry Niel but I'm still laughing at that picture. The irony is so beautiful
Hey you were just feeling it all out first week...now you're gonna make changes and go undefeated from now on
I hate Portland
BY PIPA
YESS
I didn't realise 😳
Trapp is more like beckerman
I don't hate him
Zardes is not that great. And yeah I wish the USA v Colombia game was closer because I'd love to see that
I think so yeah. And we'll you can't really blame jozy he was out immediately
You don't anymore?
I still think the red bulls will be good just maybe not quite as good as last year. And then Toronto and maybe Montreal will be the biggest competition
League
And nah I think we should still expect to be among the top 3. We have the squad and experience
Maybe. We did get tarek though so if we need to we have depth
I want either that or the MLS cup and I'll be pleased
It's so dumb. I had to watch that
THAT'S THE SPIRIT
You guys have no faith. My prediction is 3-1 Columbus. Also I have no idea that pk was lame
Craig I said I liked yours last night!
Niel I love it 😂  I wish I could see the matchups!
Thanks I was trying to help McCoy come up with one last night and that one was too good to give to him 😂
381-422
Is Niel in this?
I laughed at both yours and Craig's haha I love a good player pun
I'm loving the team names guys (except you Brian)
Yeah I think I'll get drogba too
Both but I don't understand the app lol
You know... That's a good idea actually thanks
Get out of here I'm the champion. And I'm trying to get myself to make it now. I hate making squads for the first time 😩
Yeah idk what that is and I already have my app idea... But Nick approves so I assume it makes sense
I lost 3 clean sheets in the same minute
That team ruined club for me honestly. I'm jealous that McCoy has a fun team that's actually good
That was a good article and yeah I've seen that kind of thing so much lol
😏😏😏
Why are they all staggered 😭😭
I hate you. Also mine is the week after next week
I don't know who that is but I'm all for iy
Yeah this could be good for you!
I say go for it
I didn't even recognize him
Justin Cooper
Guys...
For the first week they're putting them all on Sunday I think
2?
I had firmino on my bench and Jesse lingard got put in for 14 minutes to keep him out of my lineup. Wtf
Brian do you have early class or would you wanna play some?
Nah lol I liked that on Facebook forever ago
Hey there's nothing gay about runescape
Same
We all have a bad week sometimes 😪
What did I ever do to you Craig
They're getting destroyed by a fetus
Really reassuring 😂
Seriously I will. McCoy said he's down. Anyone else?
Me neither honestly
Spring break
I wanna come down
It's pretty good... I mean not really the same though
We only just got it like a month ago
Like like like
I'm so excited to play together 😍😍
I just don't like the black
I like this recap
First place: Logan
Even I can watch them with like the 6 channels we get with those antennas... This is amazing
A little defensive but yes
proob
I tried to read that like 3 times
Actually it was even better he said he's a fan of obscure jerseys...literally my exact words!!!
I wore the Doumbia jersey for pickup tonight and immediately got a compliment. Thanks @Brian Hoffman 
They haven't
That was real pretty
I know there just a pretty big stat gap
Doesn't look like it to me...
I'm not, sorry :(
Yeah I'll have to go search for it but it's all good
I did not actually..
That's what I'm talking about
I approve then
I was so confused I thought the "cast" in the name was supposed to be  for Casto
You're dumb
Ohh
And Brian is after like a month
Also Craig is
Most of us
Where's Columbus??
Like in premier fantasy lol
Yeah that's def Emily's email 😂
loganpatino10@gmail
That, dodgeball, and white men can't jump were our go-tos for a while
Omg 😂
Nick you're so dramatic 😂
I'll still be there on weekends brahs
I'm really excited to see both my countries play in a competitive game though
It came out for them earlier this week b ri
That's beautiful 😂😂
I have no idea he's all I found 😂
Oh okay. Well that's still gonna take extra schooling!
What are you thinking now?
Says the guy who wants to go to law school...
Most likely
Goals
This was gold omg
I don't even know how to begin to pronounce it
#mourinhoin
#vangallout
My guy
???? 
Well Nick somebody's gotta hold down the cbus fort
Atta boy Niel
I'll try to be at a lot of games this year though and maybe I could get season tickets elsewhere
Sorry fam...I'll probably be relegated to a long distance fan
?
I actually have thought about it. Aren't they sold out though (
I know! That was a really fun game
https://youtu.be/txbRw-Waoyw

Start at 41:30 and just watch the rest, we show up a few times!!
Guys a bunch of us ended up in a crew supporters video!!!
Omg I did too I was like well we're screwed
Brian is strictly a Jake Miller fan
I didn't realize champions league was back!
What game?
He's straight out of a cartoon
hb @Nick Casto 
Shoulda sent a pic
Villa... wyd
That was lit
I have no idea what that means
Nick "Doumbia" Casto
So much power in the shot that you went down 😂
Wherever Doumbia goes I will follow
Yeah I found out the other day when I couldn't find him on FIFA. Well...
Did anyone else know my boy is on Newcastle?
They screwed up my fantasy week already
fav
That's weezy. Get with the times Brian
I just listened once I don't really remember!
I listened to that one actually it is pretty good
I thought it came out yesterday?
wtf
No 4 would be perfect. We'll all be done by then and we can go eat before the game!
Well I wouldn't say party 😂  When are you gonna be here?
I'm a real friend
I read that it's just a one year thing
It's a subtle gradient thing
I think there could've been some better execution but I'll take it
I said I liked its uniqueness! 
I never said I didn't like it
Nick my thought on it is if they're gonna make the top funky just go wild with the rest so I'll take the shorts
Hold on Niel
What kind of Columbus kid are you
It's the colors of the flag. The flag is literally on the jersey
It'll def be a collector's item someday!
I like the idea though
Unfortunately not a lot of people are really into the flag here or even know what it looks like
The brand is already unique. They just wanna connect with Columbus more
And yeah we didn't have the best material to work off of 😂
And I will say I like the uniqueness
Craig our black from last year is the new home kit
Black is home, this is away
I mean it looks okay. and as a shirt it will still be unique
yeah that was the painful part
They just look very disjointed
The presentation is painful
Yeah I'm watching now lol
Dang too late :/
I didn't actually I hadn't looked it up
Thanks for the support Brian
And yeah it could look better in person.
Also I read last night that the crew will be bringing back the yellow kits for select games like a third kit, so it's not all bad
At least it's mostly yellow?
Ehhh... I'll just hope maybe the leak is a bit off..
We just did it. Nice
I think it would be a game but I'd bet on Leicester
Leicester has kept like 5 clean sheets in the last 7 games and has the most goals scored in the league
Leicester
Hey I'm always down for whatever. I've never been invited to uc
When do they start playing?
I would grace your presence, yes
*THE Logan Patiño
I wouldn't mind going to one
😔
Also I meant family of animals in general
Nothing they are your children and deserve to grow up in a safe environment
Niel this is no place to raise a family of dogs
What's going on??
That's scary af. Kudos to you for talking to him honestly
Did anything happen or they just walked in? That's really scary
That's what made me think about it. I got out bread and nobody showed up 😢
He was an awesome dog. I'm just glad to get it off my chest because I didn't really wanna think or talk about it much yesterday
It was literally within a span of a few days that we knew anything was wrong
Xander passed away yesterday morning 
Guys,  since we're all family I feel like there's something you should know
You didn't reach the man fun you wanted though 
Why would you cut it why not just keep growing??
Let's see it 
The masters isn't super important for computer science only because there are good jobs without it. It might be cool though 
That is pretty awesome. They have a program like that here too but I don't know if I'll do it or not 
me rn
Believe me I'm not happy about it
Yeah I'm all in on the Tottenham hype train
I dropped ozil this week he really disappointed me
He's just too good
I wouldn't mind it it'd be cool to see him in the prem
Newcastle winning the league confirmed
Wil is just a fundamental guy. Next Kyle beckerman basically
Out of all of them you think tchani has the most potential??
I think they'll try to get most players in and at worst they're probably like 2nd string at their positions
I'm wearing my crew jersey for the cbus trio
3:45 on ESPN2 I think!
but Nick 😪
We grown
@McCoy Patino 


hb
Me
Fa cup unfortunately
RIP in peace my feathered friend
Yes they literally had to fish his body out of mirror lake 😪
😭😭😭
Brian's gonna start using it now
I was gonna say 30 and I was still too old wow
A camping trip could be done on a long weekend which would be nice
I'm always down for whatever
What about Craig and Niel? And yeah I liked last year
I will check soon
Nah see j Mac cost a lot. So we saved some money there. And then we got rid of schoenfeld. Now we got casey who probably didn't cost too much. Opening roster and cap space for...
Yeah I saw a bunch of those tweets...I don't understand
😏
Looks like Minnesota and Wisconsin
Yes let's make it a tradition 😂
Do it on a weekend and I'm there
Nick fr have a party
That's what being 21 is all about just ask Niel and Brian
Down for all of that
I don't know where or how you found that but same
👀
but yes
Well I don't think I'd call it a resurrection, considering you never have been
Niel honestly...I'm proud of you.
I love that you answered 😂😂
It was so mean lol I was having a bad day and just didn't wanna hear a bad joke
Also Brian not bad but it doesn't fulfill the requirements of the class :(
I'm pretty sure kolin petty is actually the one who told her that
😊
It sounds so much more smooth looking back. I was a real ladies man back in the day
I feel so exposed
Yeah don't do that again
That sounds cool! And what games?
Setup looks clean
Halo 5??
@Craig Casto 
omg
MY GOALIE AND DEFENDER NO
😂 we haven't decided yet but we still have a couple weeks
gg nick
Yeah I traded arnautovic
Hence my pic
I know. McCoy convinced me last night to pick lukaku over him 
Highly recommended
What a great week to transfer in firmino 😊
Pretty much anything. It just needs to have an interface, to use some external service (like maps), to hold data, and to use a phone sensor. But I can build off of any ideas
I'm just messing with you I mean I've played the game before lol
If anyone has a cool phone app idea that my group can use please speak now
What happened to you
Yeah I did but I didn't really get any responses. The company does look cool though
Thanks! And yeah, they give interns housing at Cleveland state so I'll have a dorm there. 
Westlake, it's like 20 minutes left of Cleveland. It's at a company called Hyland Software. And nick Idk like every few weeks or so it'll be all good!
Weekends!
Finally something going right for my team ❤
@Brian Hoffman 
I'm assuming not
I'm annoyed because I was so close to picking him up last night and took payet instead
McCoy did but I haven't yet 😪  @Brian Hoffman

No?
Oh yeah I saw that 😪

My school's liberal arts and we don't need a religion class. But I guess it could fit with the whole treating patients thing
Why do you have a religion class?
I haven't done much yet but the classes all seem interesting
Says you of all people 
fml
js
First day of second session and I'm bringing up the rear 👍
Just FYI to everyone, prem games start back up today
A mobile app design class
Lol no but it actually is kind of an art class
First class was strictly syllabus and let out of early 😊
😂😂 it's in the process!
The day I do I will come to you for help ❤
I'd want that to be my own thing and this is for McCoy and I to share
Yeah I know all that and someday I'd like to but not now
I am not worthy
s'ready 😈😈😈
v good. The packages got there a few hours ago
Well my first class is at 5:30 but I'll let you all know how much syllabus time I get
😪
You can just give it to Sarah (she'd better not be)
Hey I mean if she didn't tell me I wouldn't know any better...
I heard that's amazing!!
U 2 THAT GAME WAS AWSUM
I got a CSKA Moscow Doumbia jersey from Brian
!!
Convince him plz
Yep I'm down for that
I'm free all day
Whenever!
Yeah mane
Either 5:50 or 9:10 for me!
Niel when are you getting your jersey??
Okay. It doesn't even have to be an overnight thing since you'll be leaving the next day but I'd love to come over and play a bit
Okay. Wednesday maybe? Or Tuesday before star wars?
What time Thursday?
Craig give me a reasonable answer and I'll drop it
I just don't understand why you need to leave tomorrow??
Craig. One more day for a fifa tournament
Bring Craig kicking and screaming if you need to.
Yeah so come whenever
That's why I was thinking if we started around 6 we could be done before too late
I think so
Tonight you don't have to. When can you tomorrow?
What is this in??
Craig you can't run away forever
Really whatever's doable for everyone
Sooner rather than later... Maybe get started at like 6? Anyone else have an idea?
Alright guys for the tournament tomorrow (and this includes you Craig): we're playing fifa 15 and the rule is we all pick a 4 star team (or lower) and then you get to transfer 3 players into your chosen team. And we're going to do the round robin idea we mentioned about a week ago
Nick it's all good.
This is Friday night though
THE FINAL JERSEY HAS ARRIVED
If we get everyone together then yeah I'm cool with that
It's almost exactly the same for me
Yeah why?
Whenever we all get together! Someone from the first through third
😳 it's all good I get it lol
If you needed to go to the mall you could join me. And wow way to go we could've watched them together 😡
During or after?
I might go spend some gift cards
We still have a few days so there's a chance!
I'm s'down
Hot af
Y
I just need to know...
Craig you can't be embarrassed you asked for it
I'm gonna need pics
I was too slow on the gif searching
Yep they were sitting right by the goal!
Alright I left a sweatshirt there too so I picked them both up
Craig did you bring a mount Carmel hoodie to the field yesterday?
You said you wanted me to send you the map. And McCoy needs it to send out the pics
WHAT IS YOUR EMAIL
NICK
Nick what's yo email
I just sent it to you
What's your email Craig?
loganpatino10@gmail
Also zach it's all good just let us know
Yeah you can send money to someone if they don't have the app
You can use Google wallet for it. I'm down if everyone wants
@Craig Casto and @Zach Spangler you guys want to come over tonight? It'll make it easier to get up for tee off at 9 tomorrow ;)
I'm down with either. We can do a sleepover since we're soccer golfing in the morning!
I'm all for it!!
Yessir
Uhhhh 👀
I don't need to train to beat you craig
Ninny and pop are getting here! And just dinner and stuff. Feel free to come chill whenev
Well I just took a shower so :/
Imma guess grandparents
1-3 we can figure it out. That's when we'll do the tourney and the exchange. Christmas eve we'll do the soccer classic 
I'm cool with Christmas eve then
I hope so! Although Zach said he might be busy
Just got my jersey! Who all doesn't have theirs?
Dang well never mind then. Not a fun few days 😔
Or you and McCoy can come with Julie and I to das
We can watch arsenal get smashed later
Whenever!
ily @Nick Casto 
Wow nick you're making us look bad
How is that audacious at all? He scores or assists like every game
I'm good with either back to back on the 23rd or just keeping the classic on Christmas eve and doing the fifa tourney later. Preferably the first option
It doesn't have to be overnight just later that day
Good though it's all up to Niel now
WE SAID THAT LAST YEAR
@Niel Skalican @Zach Spangler and everyone else what are you doing the 23rd. We're thinking this could work for the SOCCER Classic and the FIFA tournament
Oh okay jerk
Same 😂  Wait you mean in two hours?
Whenever I just need to get up and eat!
I'm down
No
Hey Brian
Hey Brian
I'm cool with it too
I don't
Honestly I'm down for either
What a loser
Brian you're in the middle
#teamnoballs
Thanks Niel you understand me <3
Craig fr though...ouch
Why can't you love me this much Niel
Niel whatchu got against baylee
This all isn't necessarily happening. I mean like Niel said you know the situation better than anyone else. Just be aware
Woah now he never said they were actually going to end things. Nick I do think you should try and work it out just don't be a pushover if it really bothers you
I guess but you've gotta stand strong
No I mean why is she working out with him don't stand for that
Why??
Who's skip?
Of course!
Yeah I'm worried about mine tbh
😔
Yeah I'm not blaming her for the distance thing either because that's tough but the whole ex thing is unfair
The feeling is still there... That's not fair to you. She has to understand that
If she said that she still is in love with him then yeah. I agree with Niel. She's got to figure that out and you shouldn't be taken along for the ride
I was just thinking because she didn't mention it. But yeah that's tough because there's really nothing you can do about that. I mean neither of you really knew how you'd handle the distance before all this though
Maybe wait out Christmas break and see how that goes...but it sounds like she betrayed your trust and I would have to have a serious talk about where to go before keeping up the relationship
Nick that sucks and I'm really sorry. I did see her working out with some guy but I had no idea it was her ex and hoped it wasn't a big deal. I really hope it all works out whatever the outcome
Yeah man I'm just helping her make those gainz we'd all do the same thing!
❤
You are truly a changed man
Says the kalin and Myles fan
POPPIN PILLS IS ALL WE KNOW
DONT YOU LET OUT THAT ANTIDOTE
No you should not
Sure you do 😏
So grateful I don't have tests like that
#doshiguaines
Our profile has gone up so much we'd sign...Gonzalo higuain
That's weird
Yeah I saw that
My answers are exactly the same as Niel's
Yeah she did so it's all good lol
Yeah I just waved and said hey. I wasn't sure if she'd recognize me tbh
Yep the RPAC I think this is the first time I've ever actually seen her on campus lol
Nick I just saw ya gurl
@Niel Skalican 
There's still some time after that
Oh 😂😂
Niel when will you be back from your excursion?
Dad's legacy?
That one is no surprise. So our signings this year were either really good fits or cut after one season lol
@Brian Hoffman 
Oh snap sorry Brian
Oh that's fine we usually kick off around 1 in the morning anyway
Niel if I don't see you all break I'm coming down to Cincinnati and punching you in the neck.
Last finals day for everyone? Mine is the 15th
Nah I still like higuain
Yeah I thought that too. Our midfield is our best thing and I don't really want to upset that balance
I still like meram though... Just maybe not as much as cedrick. And yeah we need some more center back depth
I know who I want to play
With kristinn? Nobody
Yeep. We're not gonna be there quite at 1:30 but we'll be there by 2
Ya
Nick what do you think parking will be?
That fine we won't be able to anyway lol
At like 12:30. We just thought of it this morning though and Julie's not up yet so Idk if we'll be able to
Why??
We were planning on eating already so that works out most likely
Maybe...where at?
Whatchu mean?
u wot m8
We're going to campus around 12:30 and trying to get to the stadium at 1:30
Btw my jersey has been purchased
WHY ARE YOU SO PESSIMISTIC
Nah we're good
Stop
So
I'm down for whatev (also Craig we scored on you all day)
The Columbus Crew are winning 5-1 tomorrow according to our fifa prediction 
That gif was perfect and I respect that
Niel I think you're saying something but I can't hear you from all the way down there
I don't wanna hear it from you Brian. Mr. Mid Table
Niel... You suck
jk
I hate you guys
@Niel Skalican 
Dang that's expensive I didn't realize that. And I agree lol if I get one I'll wait.
30 bucks is probably around the right price though. I'd guess $20-30
Yeah a little bland but cool regardless. and the tweet didn't say. They start going on sale Saturday at 10
I agree. And maybe spread it out a bit
Guess what...I'll be there at 1:30
Yeah I saw they are selling MLS cup scarves! I definitely want to be there when the gate opens
I'm not sure. I only saw something about the stadium opening at 2
Early. What time are you?
That is beautiful
Either or will be fine I think
Ah okay. You still think it'll work?
And I do have mine from last game I think
I would like to get in. What do you mean still print tickets?
I have not and do not want to lol
I saw that actually lol
Same tbh it still hasn't hit me that we're ACTUALLY going to watch them play in the final
Well I'm glad they chose today to be off on finishing
They were just trying to hold on
Yeah you're not missing this
THAT WAS WAY TOO SCARY
Finlay needs to finish something
*Finlay
I know. I'm just saying I'm pretty sure we were second highest scoring and regardless I see us getting one. and no matter how good they are I do not see them getting 4
I don't either. We're a lot stronger mentally than last year
It was really nice. That would've been an awesome way to (hopefully) advance
Yeah we really just need that one. But I'm confident we can score
Scary stuff but we've definitely had the better chances
Scratch that. Crew repeat the 2-0 result and red bulls fold as an organization
Nice. I say 2-1 red bulls
😃😃😃😃
Omg
This is it... Win and we HOST
I'm hoping. I've accepted not making it though
😂😂 you've gotta give it up
Very true but come on. He joined a week late
Niel...
When are you done Brian?
I didn't actually see, what happened?
My boy ❤
You can search for gifs in the app
I guess that makes me level 8 too because I best him the other day too
But it's unfair... Craig's a level 7 ping pong master
I've gotta get on that soon
Who else has it?
I'd like to do 16 if possible
Sounds good to me!
😪
I can't I've gotta pack up and be up early
I'm home!!
Regarding the qualifier though that'd be pretty awesome
We don't talk about that
We're practically a rich team in these playoffs!
And Dallas is second lowest
The group chat name speaks the truth
I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D HAVE THE CHANCE
3-1 omg THERE IS A CHANCE
Yeah if we host we'll figure it out. And Niel I think it's weird too but I'm not complaining. And they just give you the money back
Idk I'm hoping someone can get me in the nordecke
I got the cheapest ones for a little over $40
Assuming we win and Portland wins it's here! And Dec 6 at 4!
McCoy, Julie, and I all have our tickets 😎
I'm getting on RIGHT NOW
We're leaving OSU rn
Come over Niel
I'll be there
After Nick's work!
It's all good. And I'm down for it
Prob not then 😔
Because of the cold though most people will probably go play indoor instead
Not rainy but yeah pretty cold
Idk how many people will be out but we can chexk
I'm still down if you want
No he cannot
Yeah he is
Wait Brian you play??? It looks so fun
Yeah rocket league looks awesome actually I've wanted it but can't play it
Yeah forward that message to us
We leave Wednesday. And I'm not sure I don't have plans at the moment
Not this you dumb. And they wanted to have people see the new place. He'll be here for Christmas though
???
How does one craze heroclix
We're going down to south Carolina for thanksgiving with the gparents
I just realized McCoy and I are gonna be gone most of break... 😔
I'm always down
Niel... You are forgiven
I will never forget because that was redemption for all the times we played back in the day 😂
Niel let's be real...you can't even beat me at 21
@McCoy Patino 
Both at the same time, duh
Crew game??
So Niel while you're here
Honestly idk I don't really keep up with them
Messi's hurt so yeah you can't even really fairly compare. And ronaldo will probably be right back to his usual in like a few months and then you'll forget you ever said this
Brian wtf is your avatar
WHY are you sucking up to Brian
The man, the myth, the beard
Did you finally?
I have seen the dank in person
Zach where are you?
I can get there in like 5 min tops
I get out of class at 12:30 and I just told Julie we were gonna run over there asap!
I will just let me know!
Yeah right!
That sucks. And isn't there a guest one?
You're not gonna be there all day?
I would but I have class 8-9:20 😫
I just got here too! So wait what are you here for?
There's a garage yeah
Zach time??
I saw that!! Def buying
I didn't have class today anyway so 😑
I mean Niel???
Nick you can really go??
It's at 5 I'm pretty sure
Niel I would be happy to see you again
😂😂😂
Brian buy his ticket
That seriously sucks. But the least I can do is try to find someone to buy your ticket for yoy
He just bought one today lol. Why can't you go??? 😪
They even broadcasted two games wtf
IMAGINE BEING THERE. MY POOR THROAT
WHAT A GAME
2-1 Columbus. Jack McInerney scores the winner in the 120th minute
???
Sorry lol I don't think I do
Seriously you were trying to tear the family apart
"wasent"
Does a one-legged duck swim in a circle?
Yeah it should be solid!!
Yes sir I went the whole 9 yards and got the playoff package
You can't say no at this point
Oh I know what that is! I got an email from school asking for volunteers and I almost did it because it sounded interesting
I agree with you. A piece of him is still in Massachusetts somewhere
Wait Zach are you going?
Beautiful insight, Zach. Thank you
Fine wine
I'll give some mammograms
I doubt MIT is really a big part of that
High five Craig 🙏
To be fair to my school, Ohio state's athletic program is self-sufficient
Niel you would retweet a Swedish national team tweet
Alright and alright
Yeah I'm at the soccer game vs Michigan and it's actually packed it's pretty cool
Oh you had it right I called him back
What'd you say?
I just saw the MLS cup with my own eyes
What does he want?
Assisted by rafffffffffael
That's awesome! And we are doing it. Should we start texting Julie whenever?
I think so
Julie and I will!
Yeah I hope your other half of the prediction is correct too
😂😂
Finlay was being shut down
How do you lose that there
Idk but that was ugly
FLAIR
Nick you sound bitter
I do agree with that prediction though. Maybe 2-2
Just because we're all fans doesn't mean we all think we're gonna win
Score predictions?
Who were you saying would ball out though?
Niel: good call
 That's my boy 😄😄😄
I'm excited too it should be good. I shouldn't be so worried about one guy but Drogba is pretty much good for a goal a game
So how're you guys feeling about playing Montreal?
Ol' Donovan tickets. That's because turf = 👎
Did you see the defense on EVERY goal?
They're going all the way hence the group chat name
That picture is incredible
Galaxy out in the first round makes me so happy
Yeah that show is really bad about that
Omg yes I didn't know what you meant by max air. That was so hilarious I thought someone was gonna get hit by all those coins 😂😂
I feel like I do vaguely... Remind me
We never decided there would be a shield winner!
Let's settle it this way. If we both get some sort of message telling us we won something then you get that and I get the cup
Funny thing is I took out davies for adi and davies had a pretty good day that would've made it less tense
Brian it was a really good final. And no I don't think so
🏆
He doesn't score very much
Yeah I really did not see him getting two goals
That's why I don't say anything because you never know
I said earlier if big celery scores we win the cup for sure...

 "Fake chow"
Zach I see that you have our group chat muted and I am hurt
We can start the jersey exchange stuff whenever right?
At the very least I was entertained
Fifa is usually Brian. Other things though
To be fair to nick he's generally been pretty good in competitions
Niel you are ruthless today 😂😂
This is great 😂😂
👀👀👀
Okay lol. Yeah he's been on there for a while though so who knows when that happened
Is he in right now?
Really? I've had him for like 2 months then lol
Guys I just found out I'm playing for the final in MLS fantasy today
Yeah it went the other way real quick 😪
Why can't you go?
lol @ tottenham
Big day! Go city!
Don't hate me!
Still looking pretty dreary. I'm not sure there's gonna be much of a crowd
Assuming it doesn't rain!
Craig you dead
It's a larp clan Brian. Please.
It looks like a chance of rain... Temperature looks good though
That sounds awesome and speaking of playing nick I'm good for Saturday
Brian that was messed up 😂😂
I'll have to see if Julie wanted to do anything but as of right now I'm down
Saturday? I could be down for dat
Doumbia scored on man u. He cannot be stopped
Bout to be LIT and why not?
Ew
Ew
I guess I was gonna have to fess up sooner or later
Even football players want to be him
He was a born Andre but we still need to find our places
Oh believe me I am!!
Yeah I was gonna say I don't follow with the flower shop and thin pants
😂😂😂  I will happily be ruxin he's the coolest one
Don't McCoy and I have to be Pete and taco?
Please 😂😂
Of course you always have been
So who am I playing??
Sounds like a boo the way they do it
Zeeeeeeeeeeeekeeeee
I know. And it's really weird to see OSU in black lol but they're pretty sexy
These jerseys are nice
I was freaking out like how
WOW
We're looking really good!
😂😂😂😂
Loftus check!
Nobody it was a pitiful attempt
You guys suck
The Brutus one is good
We tried that remember??
That cannibal pumpkin is amazing. and this isn't a proposal 😂
Sorry to change the subject but I have an important question. Julie and I are about to carve pumpkins and I need everyone's opinion on what to make. I'll give everyone until 8:10 to give your suggestion and I'll pick my favorite. Also McCoy, if Craig doesn't get this just tell me his
🙌🙌🙌
😭😭😭
Hit the question marks. Yeah they mean like $1 million plus
I remember you telling me about that 😂😂😂
We are in a no-judgement zone... I respect your opinion Zach
Also...good point Zach. It's for SURVIVAL
Hitler was a real OG
If we had all the smartest people only passing genes along though we would be a super race
It's more about being ethical at that point 😂
Yeah but I mean you can't just tell people not to reproduce!
Yeah that's impressive. And in a way way less insensitive way I could say that ideally I would love for certain people to not reproduce necessarily and that we'd be better off with others passing genes along but I mean that's just so messed up 😂
😡
But in reality yours has been the most conservative so there's some truth to that
Brian you are a straight up old man Jeffers from southern Alabama
What percent is Bernie?
Haha yeah I noticed McCoy's was longer than yours and tried to do every one. I'm also bad about really picking a side for like the somewhat thing lol
Yep I'm not too surprised by that lol
Same apparently!
Brian's is fairly different
Alright time to do mine
YA COMMIE
Quite a mouthful. Brian's a leftie too
Brian trump was surprisingly high for you
McCoy it's true
I'll do it soon
How long does that take?
That seems pretty difficult... And I had no idea
Now how do you figure that...
😂😂😂
Yeah the one against Honduras right?
You mean yesterday?
Yeah my biggest fear is that wil finally starts getting into the national team consistently and is played out of position
Pretty much never I'm just saying he's that weapon
Hey yedlin is a pretty fast wing
Woah now...this is not a young team
The game isn't until 9:30
Nice pic btw
For?
Oh I know. Feel free to change it whenever you can search for a pic from the app
Did you see it was actually a gif?
Doesn't matter either way. Although I set the group picture just for you 😉
I'm guessing ESPN
That's a good point I just always think it makes so much sense for him to play there
I agree with just about all of that. I was gonna suggest maybe Cameron but I'm fine with he or Brooks. Also fine with guzan. And maybe have Dempsey play underneath of jozy instead of with him up top
I understand that. I'm fine either way honestly guzan would just have the edge for me. And I could see both of them starting
I don't think it's a very big step down though. And I'm okay with that little step down for someone who's been with the team consistently lately
I just got the app but I never had problems without it the past month. And even though he hasn't been with the team?
Have faith!! Although I'm a bit nervous
Craig why
I forgot about that. Alright sounds good
Oh I didn't know you were home! Well Julie and I were gonna do some pumpkin carving while we watched...that sounds really fun though so I'll ask her what she thinks
Ya boi
Nick you're optimistic?? I'm watching at home
Easily. And I'm gonna say...3-2 USA
Oh yes I am. And who do they play?
Hey guys I was using this app for a project class at school and it works really well for group messages. That way McCoy and I won't have weird issues with images and missing things so if you're cool with it I wanna use this
