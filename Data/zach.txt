If the DNC didn't force their candidate on us, who would've probably paid the DNC members loads, Democrats may have one. It's a cover for the DNC fraud

It's a Sony Vaio,  I actually remember getting it at your request lol!  But it's not a huge deal with my desktop,  just kinda annoyed I can't get it. I can't restore,  refresh,  boot from USB,  literally nothing.  It'd just a bios screen or cmd prompt 
Yeah it's been two months,  I can't restore or anything.  Just boot I to bios,  my guess is a CD will help,  but booting from a USB won't.  
Do any of you guys have a Windows CD I could use this weekend?  My laptop says it has no OS installed and I can't get it to work at all.  

Aren't we all Mac on this blessed day
No lol he didn't mention any of you suckers

The elephant says "I know, I brought my own!"
