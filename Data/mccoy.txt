u r my savior
Nick, I use Python for my coding classes!
yeah lmao my supervisor sent me some tutorials for React and he was like "the first one's stupidly easy." but to do the tutorial you need working knowledge of js and XML/HTML rip me
and React uses JSX, which means I have to use XML
which means I have to learn JavaScript
well before I can even work on the project I have to learn React
@Logan Patiño have I told you about what I have to do for my UROP
there's a sign on one of the pillars in MIT's main lobby asking people what their favorite strain of marijuana is and a marker for them to record it on there with
it's lit in Boston
if u mean that come to Boston rn
I'm a
I'm no fairy princess
:(
lit
so you're moving after she comes up?
Logan what unit is it kire and I wanna creep
yeah thanks for the heads up bro
YOU'RE LITERALLY ON THE SAME STREET AS MY SCHOOL
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
who do u know at Google to get hooked up with that
???
looks like 15 GB, which should be plenty for backing things up
Drive is good for backing things up as well, I'm not sure how many GB of free storage you get tho
if it's just the email account I could actually just make some mailing lists and give you guys the addresses so you could get the storage space
I'm not sure if you have to have MIT certificates or if you just need an @mit.edu address but you can get 18,000 terabytes of storage on Dropbox for free
Dropbox
lmao rip in pieces
@Nick Casto I'm chipping away at your lead in prem fantasy 👀
hot
And considering I've never been paid to work before (though I did get a paid research position recently), it's def not bad at all
I get a $6000 stipend but have to pay about $2500 for a mandatory meal plan and housing at Caltech
truuuu
I couldn't turn it down
it doesn't pay very much at all but it's JPL so like
10 weeks!
you're right, I'm so sorry
I just accepted the offer yesterday 😄
I'll be in Pasadena, CA
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory!
my internship starts on the 20th :/
send me pics of your shenanigans
rip
@Nick Casto when is the Myrtle Beach trip planned for?
Talk to me when you win a three-peat
jk Nikki's ridiculous and idk how Christian Guzman broke up with her
she aight
pls
y'all
whaaaaaat
were going to?
guys, I'm dropping out of school and moving to Germany to become a professional baker
this is the last one I swear
@Logan Patiño I AM DECEASED
political and coding memes
@Logan Patiño 
It is! 6.042 memes boi
MIT's meme group on Facebook is absolutely hilarious
it's impossible to be interested in March madness if you don't have a team to root for
I'm so pissed I didn't turn in my bracket on time
It's Bao
WAIT SHE DOES I FORGOT
Hm, maybe they decided to be less traditional
Are both her parents Vietnamese?
No idea lol Julie asked how she chose Kire and she said "Kire chose me"
TRIANGLE
nah she doesn't have a middle name lol
her legal name is Tran but she goes by that
Kire is my gf
I watched Iron Chef America with Kire lmao St. Patty's was lit
THE CARAVAN!!!!!
Do it
I just need someone to join me in MA, it's lonely without you all
but Tufts probably has a good program and they're like 15 minutes away
unfortunately I don't think we do unless you want to switch to bio engineering
Craig come to tMIT
lol I never go on Reddit so I didn't know about that bot but I appreciate its existence
like, a lot
but yeah, that does suck
And "I'm contacting you" (apostrophe)
Remember that it's "would have" instead of "would of"
I'll play
Free!
D's up on them girl's chest

gotta say blart
Logan did u do this
yo blart
I like the idea, I'm a fan of tattoos and immortalizing Ohio in any way
I'm v confused
@Craig Casto At NASA I would probably work with coding for flight systems and Microsoft would actually be next summer and it would be a project development program at their campus outside Seattle
And I'll hopefully be back for at least a little bit this summer!
I love you Nick, thank you for making me sound more impressive than I actually am
....and now I'm considering course 16 very seriously (Aero/Astro)
sorry for the late responses, I was talking to someone/eating Chipotle lol but yeah, I think having her as a contact will really help me with finding something at NASA
It was so awesome!! We basically talked the whole time about what I enjoy doing and what I want to work with and how I like a little bit of everything and that's why picking a major is hard and she was saying that I think like a systems engineer and how great that is for work at JPL
Got Microsoft at 3:30 boiiiii but I'm honestly just completely in love with NASA
Just finished my interview with NASA JPL, guys!!!!! It went so well too!!!!!!
danke Logan
whoops lol that is important
471 Memorial Drive, room 6-301
actually that's not true it's fun in a masochistic way
I think I've written 1,000 lines of code for this project and written more complex logic statements than I ever care to write again
Thank goodness it's almost Java but still
C++ (teensy 3.2)
i want to die
and this robot I made
guys look at this hat I made
Lol I would prefer to only do prem because in all honestly I hardly pay attention to MLS for longer than a few weeks aside from the Crew
@Niel Skalican EXPLAIN.
fly me out to it and I will so be there for a party
MEET MORE PEOPLE (ESPECIALLY CUTE WOMEN)
WORK YOUR HARDEST
MAKE IT HAPPEN
@Logan Patiño 
I haven't gotten any bday poon but I did get this body pillow
Muchas gracias 😄
*oui
i would die for you nick
who's Earl Grey
the worst was her exchange with Tim Kaine, she was dodging every question
I am so concerned
February 3rd is going to literally kill me
I may or may not be going but it's looking sort of unlikely and I unfortunately won't know for a while
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It gets sooooo bad
If I played that game alone at night I would literally die
We'll see in hopefully about a month if I'll be able to 😄
I'M DYING RN
AND MICROSOFT????
NASA'S JET PROPULSION LABORATORY WANTS TO INTERVIEW ME FOR A POSITION
I'M ACTUALLY IN ACTUAL TEARS RN
GUYS
I completely forgot you're at the beach and I was incredibly confused as to how someone was skimboarding in Ada in January
Yeah, and I had one hour to do it with no outside resources other than Oracle documentation
Yeah, I'm much less stressed by this one than by Two Sigma's even though Twitter's is going to be more difficult
let's hope mine aren't too technical lol but I'll probably have to watch some OCW as well
rip
How many questions tho
How long was yours?
Yep! Or, as the email put it, 10,080 minutes lol
@Logan Patiño guess who got invited to take a coding challenge for Twitter
Toronto was like 8 or 9 I think
Being uncomfortable is natural, but letting her know that you're overcoming that discomfort to trust her will mean a lot to her and be a lot healthier for the relationship
My two cents are to trust her. I think she didn't initially tell you because she didn't want to make you worried and she probably didn't react strongly when you said something because she doesn't feel anything for the guy, like you said before. You opposing the arrangement would imply not trusting her with someone who she's explicitly shown no interest in, which is not good
I hate you so much
It's JJ style!!
You're Yuri and I'm Victor
I'm so proud :'-)
lmao send a note that says "i am in great debt. help me pls"
you have to know her yourself though
hmmm... tru
can't set a precedent of giving money away too freely
the principle tho
???????????
that was ridiculous-diculous
did you guys see Giroud's goal today???
@Craig Casto 



















smh
yeeeee booooiiiiiiiiiiii
@Niel Skalican when are you going to be available?
January 7
huh. all of our finals are three hours
How long are your finals usually?
Yeah, I assume she's trying to put the pussy on the chain wax
idk, some people say it. But it looks like a drunk text to me
lol she must be drunk or something
you guys are doing that thing you always do lmao arguing just to argue
I hate you
Logan... are you sitting on the toilet in your avi
I'm with Logan
Texas toast is just thick-sliced toast lmao
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
LIKE TIMES A BILLION
You'll be living around Boston regardless though, right?
Interesting
Will it maybe be at the office that's like 30 minutes from Boston? I went to an IBM employer info session and a person there worked at that office
@Logan Patiño look where I walked past today
Craig I support you and think you're every bit as funny as your brother
mercilessly succing
if you're not on the Yuri On Ice train you're the loser, pal
this place is mercilessly sucking away my will to live but it looks wonderful <3
I might be able to, might not - I applied to a summer internship program in Israel and am probably going to apply to an international research program
There were two options there
Whenever works for you guys works for me
Holy shit
I get back on the 20th!
I know I do
Everyone here appreciates a good random jersey, right?
come to Boston
Well, Craig, have I got some news for you
Wondolowski
Chris
I mean, the guy brought Chris Wondolowski to a world cup
!!!!!!
come to Boston for this hangout night so I know it's real
lit
what
It is a matter of correlation vs. causation though, because undereducated whites tend to live in rural areas that lean Republican, often regardless of race or gender. So as for whether one thing causes the other or vice-versa, that's up for debate
Statistically, gender definitely was a factor but definitely not the only one. News outlets are just pointing out the fact that every demographic except whites, especially undereducated white males, voted in favor of Clinton
via NY Times:
from Google
I'm literally so pissed at you
lol my break is Thursday to Sunday so flying back would be very inefficient
none of the above
truuuu, we need to draw names asap
peep where he wants to go to school
That's so awesome
Holy crap! They're the ones who ruin everyone's lives with MATLAB!

???????
the fact that you still don't know how this works proves that last year was a total fluke lol
because then only a few teams are playing
smdh
hmu with the username
And then you didn't tell me you got one
I saw the wine bong tho from Donnie's story lmao impressive
I don't have you on snap wtf
This one imitates waves, so when you touch the board waves radiate outward and actually interact with other passing waves and walls constructively or destructively https://v.groupme.com/17077713/2016-10-14T15:03:35Z/2386bd98.640x360r270.mp4
At the Media Lab rn - this board takes 3D scans of a surface and recreates the model using pistons. Here you can see it imitating my hand https://v.groupme.com/17077713/2016-10-14T14:54:30Z/4b8e95a4.640x360r270.mp4
I BELIEVE IN YOU!!
i love you guys
Thank you for the sympathy guys, but I'd like to emphasize that I am handling it very well and actually agree that it will be good in the long run despite sucking rn
insanity
btw JJ Abrams, the founder of Bad Robot and producer of Star Trek, Star Wars Episode VII, etc., also used to work at the Media Lab
We're obeying the November Rule, which states that you shouldn't be in a relationship at MIT before November so you can get used to the academic rigor without distractions. I'm not too happy about it but it is a good idea tbh
btw we're not dating anymore
I just tagged him because we both love him lol
@Logan Patiño tfw Keisuke Honda works for the lab you do research in
(he's Taiwanese)
tfw u can hardly understand your recitation instructor for calc
Today's my first day of classes
It's lit! Haven't had much time at all to play tho
The candidate finding process is going well
Yeah, they're in the basement
Still something you can put on a resume! Any projects like that are 👌
Would you be able to before you graduate?
the goal is to co-author a paper by the end of this year if at all possible
I'll be applying for a position probably around the end of the semester so I'll be checking out different research I might want to get involved in
also I'm taking a salsa dancing class for the first half of the semester lol
rip
Pretty awesome! Pre-orientation/Orientation week has been v lit and we schedule classes tomorrow. Also I got into a Media Lab program, which means that I'll have card access and be doing research there this year. Hopefully I can get into the synthetic neurobiology lab they have bc it's 🔥
still a position
I used my wildcard and I'm happy with my team but this week is sucking
I'm not a United fan, I can't stand Mourinho even though he's made the team look a million times better
I love MIT
I am BEAT
I've taken almost 28,000 steps today and traveled over 11.5 miles - and that doesn't include distances I've biked
cock crack

you seem to be pretty fixated on this mug
I use lowercase because god is dead
I mean, if I have a kid (god forbid) I would put them ahead of my career so added effort isn't a problem
From what I've heard, Down Syndrome doesn't decrease perceived quality of life for those who have it so I wouldn't see a reason to abort

Depends on when we're meeting there
I'll take a shower and get ready
I mean I can just go on Sunday
I was about to head to the gym rn
Today?
wait what day?
It's a joke lmao
we could but we have to do a factory reset
it is but not with the beta software Logan and I are running
I downloaded it, tried it, cried, and forgot about it
and incompatible with Android N
https://twitter.com/FootballFunnys/status/749185986895241216?s=09 @Brian Hoffman 
why??
I don't see why not
and also he is just objectively sucking eggs
operative word being "once"
Rooney SUCKS
They suck but also Iceland doesn't get nearly enough credit
I love how McManaman and Darke are so pissed about this game
r u srs
lmao she told me about that
plus Argentina and Chile were in the same group in this tournament lmao
also the third place game is a rematch of the opener, that's even more boring
it's a rematch of last year, that's boring
I stopped watching completely
he deserves it
who the hell masturbates with dish soap
bruh, get caught up on your gay slang! a gay man's butt = his bussy

I already started laughing the second I saw the title

Did you guys see that Laurent Ciman is starting against Italy??
Ours came in today too!
Alright I'm back at the condo
She's not here
Btw Lauren and I are going to head to the beach but we'll be right across the road so if you need to get in ask for Sue's keys
*fears
I hope we pull off two wins and think we can but I also have my feara
I do too tbh
I'm 18
so I just found out that the legal drinking age in Toronto is 19
this Crew game is giving me hypertension
... but comments like that are why there's animosity lmao
I don't think there's anything wrong with you being a fan lol it makes sense
yep
because some people like Niel think they can beat the Crew's first team
I like FCC because they're an Ohio team but I'm definitely not a fan
Brian don't even say that
I'm so angry
OLA

You're honorable and it's disgusting

what do we think of Tottenham?
bomb
ESPNFC said he has a reputation for being very difficult to manage and that's why he bounces around from club to club so often
The Crew posted on Facebook saying they got "General and Targeted Allocation Money, SuperDraft picks and more"
I SAW AND AM SHOCKED
HOLY CRAP
Unfortunately Nick left and Logan is leaving
Is Craig home yet?
I love being disappointed
35 mpg boiii
Okay, okay. Then I definitely offer my car services
I could offer but it would be a little tight with three in the back

I don't care about winning, I care about beating Nick
I have neither
I was waiting for someone to mention her lol
@Brian Hoffman idk, JLaw's just kinda been putting me off as of late

I know Logan loves Zooey too lol interesting how we're all into her

She said she's not really into sports at all but she has an uncle who's an Arsenal fan and a cousin who's a Villa fan. And she loves Hamburg just because they're in Hamburg lol
She's from England actually
I have not asked her but she lived in Hamburg for a bit so probably Hamburg
DAS BOOT IS REAL, CONFIRMED BY MY GERMAN INSTRUCTOR
I can, he gets in people's faces at OSU lmao
The guy you threw shade at:
The rust belt is not exactly a vacation spot
I like the variety
Maybe I'm just more up to the idea of being away from family because one half of ours lives in Colombia
Because the world
I respect your love of this city
Who wants to join me in Germany
I'm getting New England Revolution season tickets
Listen... sometimes things have to be done
nice
He's been training for years
Don't do this Nick you will die
My goodness
Craig, you inspire me with your running
I guess so, yeah
At first I thought those were the groups and I audibly laughed
father why
I heard Kanye's album was "messy, self-absorbed, and a complete masterpiece"
I can't make out the picture, it's Jafar away
draugr-lookin bruh
All Uruguayans do
Chelsea vs PSG boi
This game got lit all of a sudden 
HAPPY ALCOHOL, NICK!!!!!
what happen
I wish I were watching
what
jfc Craig chill
Go Delle Ali
I'm upset Firmino only got an assist
When Costa's a total punk
Retweet
I want it
Oh boy
What is it?
im offended
Free labor for the Crew and higher volume of good ideas. Sounds like a win win to me
I think the flag idea is great but that it could have been done better. That being said, I do like the inclusion of all the colors even though they clash
I thought it was a gradient in the first picture and that's what I primarily didn't like
I really like it there actually
I know it's gonna get a lot of crap tho
The kit's already growing on me actually
They definitely did that well
Our flag unfortunately is a mess so this would follow
And yeah, we'll probably grow to like it
I think that would be cool
No wonder Kei wants to leave
That's the spirit
Finally
We're all gonna die
conglaturation
I'm excited for the kits
Either way thanks for the nightmares
Is that multiple worms or one giant worm
what
GOT IT
what the hyuck
Still waiting
hmm
I want this burrito
One word?
Still nothing
Who?
I did and nothing has happened

Confirmed: Jesse Lingard is the next Ronaldo
O CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN
Maybe of Delle Ali was playing they'd have scored
The cops should just chill at yours and Niel's apartments
Wow
10/10 would live in Cincy
This looks like a crowd for an practice
Man, this stadium is packed
lmao
*on
Just put it in
Oh lol I didn't even know
Are they playing now?
What
Bernie was part of the minority that opposed the Iraq war
I think Hilary's superior foreign affairs experience is something to consider but I just can't trust her like I can Sanders. She's told so many lies and half truths while changing her positions under the influence of others on so many occasions that I don't trust her to make decisions that would go against big corporations in any way
😘
Yep. Hence, why Hillary and Goldman-Sachs are so buddy buddy
The rest of them all are
Basically she's a sellout is the message
It's a video about how she's been influenced by corporations regarding policy making
Niel, seeing you slam Hillary on Facebook is incredible
I think he's lashing out because his name is so alliterative
jfc
Well, this is a good reminder of why locks are great
That's terrifying
Clean up your act
Larry what the hell
Oh wow
what
He was truly bizarre and irreplaceably so. I made a bagel this morning and missed hearing him run across the house at the sound of a bag of bread opening
Guide sleighs in the afterlife, old friend. Love you <3
But now Xander can again harass Buddy like in the good old days, so I'm sure he's happier now
Yeah, the vet who saw Xander had a dog pass away from the same thing as well. Since Xander was pretty old there wasn't really much we could do to stop it
I'm sort of glad that it was so quick because that way he didn't have to fight it for long
I don't know, they didn't really have a diagnosis. It was causing the most damage in his kidneys though
He was perfectly fine until Sunday and he was gone by Wednesday
We got medication for him but his heart probably gave out
He just got really sick out of nowhere. His immune system started killing off his red blood cells and he became extremely anemic and lethargic
When the hair tie is in the back and not on top
A Kei bun isn't a real bun tho
I'm sure I'll be able to make it back but I'll be in a sizeable hole for a few years
I have no hope of that happening
I respect you
So does he
My dad has a friend in Colombia who's a pharmacist so my dad asked if he makes a lot of money and he said "No, why would I? I just hand out pills"
Only nerds get Master's degrees
That's awesome!
No one's stopping you
Niel just do everything
He's completely right
Are warmballers no longer a thing since Jimmy's gone?

WATFORD FC WATFORD FC WATFORD FC
I love my Hornets from Watford! But I'm just a Crew fan without United
I've said it before and I'll say it again - if United hire Mourinho then I am not associated with the club until he's gone
Morgan Schneiderlin
Philip Lahm
I was trying to find the reaction GIF of the guys all freaking out and the one dude staring right at the camera in the middle but I didn't in time
Maybe if you knew his name you'd see his potential

The friend group is now filled entirely with adults

Alan Rickman (Professor Snape) has passed away from cancer
Guys, I have saddening news
Gotta learn how to treat those Jehova's Witnesses
(Or, for Craig, second week)
Speaking of which, how's everyone's first week going?
Listen, I hardly get on since classes started
Brian you're becoming addicted

Bayer Leverkusen Chicharito jersey for me, from Zach
look at that beaut
You're welcome!! Does the name bring back any jersey exchange memories?
Niel, I'm not trying to talk up my own jersey, but this City jersey is the highest quality I've ever seen from aliexpress
;)
That Cosmos jersey is amazing
Niel when is Nick getting his jersey??
Niel who's not getting their jersey
NIEL WHAT THE HELL
Ya puedes venir, pero voy a bañar

Fixed it

I did not get the jersey :(
mccoypatino@gmail.com
yo
It was shipped a few days back so we'll see
I do not believe I did
Mine hasn't arrived even though I ordered it before Logan
Nick, feel free to come over whenever
Screw Steve Harvey
How are you feeling?
And I've changed alleigance
It is now
I was gonna say Nesquik but actually Trumoo
Everything's pass/no record
Fun fact about MIT: there's no GPA freshman year
Lol I had to come clean
Not sure yet but I should have gotten like an 85-ish. Unfortunately there's no curve so it'll be a B
By the way, that 4.0 was there only because my Calc II grade hadn't been submitted yet
Lol
Niel, I joined you in the college 4.0 club!
*Mr. Spangler
ok
Yep! Nick has explosive diarrhea and Niel will be able to make the FIFA tournament and leave early
Tres?
Three?
to 3?
The soccer team should have taken the nets down after their season
You guys realize they have school today, right?
You mean at BC, right?
I would go!
 It's not that I don't have my jersey, it's just that it hasn't gotten here yet
"Robin Thicke is a disgusting man-ug me"
Hey
And yeah, Moyes was sent packing
Well, to be fair, neither of those teams were in 16th place in December
Why are you always on there 
Niel you're amazing
@Brian Hoffman we'll know in the coming months
Hopefully! We'll see what happens!
I'm thinking Physics rn
Don't worry though guys, I plan on surviving my four years
Yeah lol they changed their freshman courses to just pass/fail because too many people were committing suicide because it's so hard
Oh, they do
I love you guys so much
Yep!!
...I got into MIT
Guys
So
I should be completely free
#MyCaptainScoredAGoalAssistedByMyMidfielder
NICE
Not sure where mine is
Brian's got one ball
Brian shut up
#teamhuevos
Nick and the two bachelors are the only ball-having men left
Niel is spitting fire, Nick
We're just going to expect the worst because we don't want you to be blindsided
Verbally
Fight her
WOOOOOOOOOO
Nick who hurt u
Lol what did you expect
Liked for the photo, not the Steelers support
Me neither
Just make sure that she knows you're uncomfortable with her being around her ex. Tell her you understand that she may still have feelings and she can't do anything to change that but that if she wants it to work out between you two, she can't continue to spend time with someone else she has feelings for because that's a recipe for disaster
Liverpool always has the ugliest kits
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Being three friends and pick up five hitchhikers, we can play in the backyard

It looks good!!

me:
1. Yes
2. To select or skip songs
3. I get worried when looking away from the road, so I generally try to not look at my device
That's a tad nitpicky, don't you think?
Does skipping songs count as using your phone?
+10 for Scrubs
Parkhurst bruh
Time to buy Chris Smalling to fill in for Pogatetz and carry on Dad's legacy
That threat is made so much better by the fact that Cedrick's saying it
sure you will
Live at my house over break Niel
I like Higuain but someone else should take set pieces
WIL TRAPP FOR WIL TRAPP
ROMAIN GALL FOR HIGUAIN
BEN SWANSON FOR TONY TCHANI

We need to buy Falcao

RT FAV
NEXT SEASON BEGINS TODAY!!!! SUPPORTERS SHIELD RACE IS ON FOR 2016!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
I'm done after the 15th
Same!! I miss chilling
I saw people send pictures to Danielle of us on TV lol
If anyone was going to win besides us, I would have wanted it to be Portland. Their organization is generally very classy and today we showed we may not quite be ready for another cup yet
I'm proud of us. I'm happy with how the season went - could have been much happier had we won, but happy. Looking at the positives. One game doesn't define our season as a whole. It defined where we ended up but not who we were.
Nooice
Is this better?
Craig distracted by his own pride:
YOU LIKED YOUR OWN GIF
You:
Me:
"would attempt too"
Niel rn:
To be fair, Brian is above Nick
HE DOES NOW
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Danielle's going to be with me so we're going to need a lot of copies lol
Sounds like being a politician
What do you mean by speech? Like public speaking?
2-1 Crew with a late counterattack as NYRB presses for goals
I will most likely not be able to afford it
FINALLY
I LOVE THAT VIDEO CREW ATTENTION IN THE MEDIA WOOOOOO
sup danker
Lol yeah, I forgot to
Well I think you can figure which one I meant between those two lol
The Messiah
Ben
Wil
Big teams will, but them getting left out of semifinals will get people wondering about that approach's effectiveness
Seattle and LA both are out and the small markets are getting a lot of attention and respect for the way they're getting things done
I think this change has been coming about and will continue into the following years though 
Four teams with inexpensive teams competing for the cup... this kind of thing can change the culture of the MLS from buying to developing players and I love it
RBNY actually has the lowest payroll in the league
I meant what Logan said lol as in I got a ticket for top deck but intend to get in the Nordecke
Mine was in 205 (aka the Nordecke)
We'll see you there boys
GRAMMAR SERVED BY CRAIG
Craig, are you coming over?
Inexplicable
And we didn't even run Zeke
Over
MSU gets into the title game if they win this game and next week, right?
I am disappoint
They've got the wind behind them
moi
That's what I'm saying! If we're gonna run we might as well feed Zeke
I'm up for pizza!
Drops from Thomas and Marshall wouldn't happen otherwise. I do hate how often we're running Barrett though
Consider the conditions, fam. We wouldn't be running these plays if it weren't cold and wet
shut up
WE ARE
coming from the guy who played with THE SOUNDERS
#1 in Premier League fantasy
I mean, I didn't really go in depth but I was just talking about where each of us is going to school and the basic rundown. But it got me thinking about the fact that we're all still friends and how cool our group is
Craig: that's a good problem to have!
Everyone else: I'm currently describing our friend group to Nathalie (the Floridian friend) and it's making me realize how cool this squad is. We're awesome
Niel playing basketball:
Logan and Nick playing basketball:
There is a very distinct difference between migrants and refugees. We're making decisions with the mentality that these Syrians are migrants - which they are most certainly not.
EXACTLY
check my Twitter for a good anti-Ohio time
I'm finna bruh
Guys, the girl at the counter at a cafe at OSU complimented my name when I got a coffee... I think we're going to get married
Dang he look good. Scruffy.
You mean yes
Niel, do what I did and buy one for the south stands
We'll probably leave campus around 4
I miss the old Craig's grammar
Actually, no
I am but I had to buy a ticket in the south end and will have one of you sneak me into the Nordecke
YAAAAAAAAAAAAS
SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN TO TOOOOOWWWWWWN
I'M TELLIN YOU WHY
YOU BETTER NOT POUT
YOU BETTER NOT CRY
YOU BETTER WATCH OUT
EXPLAIN THAT
IF IT'S NOT TIME, CRAIG, THEN WHY IS MICHAEL BUBLÉ'S "SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN" PLAYING IN MY HEADPHONES
Guys, it's officially time for Christmas music
Incredible
And then you proceed to like your own message
That's a disgusting objectification of the female form, Logan
You may be on to something
That would be a great way to make easy money, actually
NO SURGERY
NO
CRAIG I AM NOT TOUCHING ANY BRAINS
Nah, they're known for being a sports powerhouse
Hopefully I can play soccer for MIT and be part of the problem
Your love, late at night
Nah, Logan's number changed to 1-800-HOTLINEBLING
One goal, two assists from my forward :'-)
Drogba gets two
3-2 Crew
Wow, jerk
I have Howard starting :/
screw Defoe
dang it
But maybe like a Sam Allardyce
We know lol
His legacy is perfect as it is
THEY'D BETTER NOT TOUCH FERGIE
Ponchettino
Moyes
Say, Mourinho
Someone who sucks in the EPL
I think it's probably more likely to get good managers to come in at the end of their careers and make a big impact than getting older players
For example, no player would willingly go to a team like Liverpool. But a load of players would love to play for Klopp and go there as a result
Good managers are always good and attract players who want to play for them
1. That would not happen
2. That would be preferable to getting old, previously good players
You should do "Dwyane" instead
That would be awesome
What a goal
I figured not lol I don't blame you
Comforting Sounds FTW
You should listen to more Birdy
Nick, please elaborate on this dream
I'm saying Portland with home field advantage
Who do you think takes it on pens?
That bit is definitely exciting
I'm watching it lol the actual soccer is absolute garbage though
Is that sarcasm or
Heck yeah they are
Logan: "You weren't fat"
dang he sexy
Wouldn't expect any less
MY SHINY TEETH THAT GLISTEN, JUST LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE
MY SHINY TEETH THAT SPARKLE, ADDING BEAUTY TO MY FACE
I'm a bitter old man
Yup
Lol I honestly think it should be but I don't want Nick to win it
You do a sufficient job of recognizing your own
Yeah, Logan just did
Did you get an award
The Supporter's Shield is not recognized by em el ess soccer.com
You mean adding?
nah fam
Alright, that's fine
Yo Nick, would it be possible to get playoff tickets for the Nordecke from you for cheap?
Chelsea's looking sharp today
We're on the rise
Take a gander at the EPL table, boys
MAKE THE PATIÑOS PROUD
LOGAN LET'S GO
Congratulations to the victors
dirty dump
idek
Logan, get over it
My right hand knows more about sports than any of your girlfriends 
Totally mine
Because Ronaldo is goals
You right
I should probably watch the new season so you guys stop ruining everything for me
Except maybe Craig
I don't think any of us is Taco
I get Jenny and Logan gets Sophia or whatever her name is
It's settled
Who's the biggest  sarcastic dick in our group
Suck it I get Jenny
YEET
Questionable
YES
I literally haven't looked at MLS fantasy in about ten weeks
Wait there are semifinals? What?
Are you criticizing Bernie's platform, sir
I was screaming
I can't believe no one's freaking out more about that game
ABC
THE REUBEN SANDWICH HIMSELF
In some senses, yes. Ethically, no
Not to mention that telling certain people to not reproduce is eugenics, something popularized by Hitler
Lol having preferable genes passed down does sound appealing. But preference is relative to individual bias
BRIAN WTF
How is it possible to be that centrist lol
Lol prally
af
Logan, it appears we have the same beliefs on each topic
I BELIEVE IN BERNIE
That man is a hero
I compared my answers with Bernie's and we had the same responses to LITERALLY EVERY QUESTION
Interesting
I am very tender, while Brian is tough
NICK YES
I have no support in Ohio wtf
MY WAR ON THE SOUTH IS AS STRONG AS EVER
